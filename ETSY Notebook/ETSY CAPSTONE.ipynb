ONCE AN ITEM LEAVES MY POSSESSION, I HAVE NO CONTROL OF SHIPPING TIMES. SHIPPING ESTIMATES ARE OFTEN 2-4 BUSINESS DAYS FOR FIRST CLASS SHIPPING; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE VOLUME OF PACKAGES BEING PROCESSED AT THIS TIME, I CANNOT GUARANTEE SHIPPING TIMES AND WILL NOT REFUND FOR DELAYS, AS I DO NOT GET REIMBURSED FOR SHIPPING DELAYS EITHER.\\n\\nPURCHASING THE PRIORITY SHIPPING UPGRADE PROVIDES $100 INSURANCE AND USUALLY HAS A SHIPPING TIME OF 1-2 BUSINESS DAYS. THIS IS ALSO NOT A GUARANTEE AND DELAYS MAY OCCUR. PLEASE BE AWARE, PRIORITY SHIPPING INSURANCE WILL ONLY COVER DAMAGED ITEMS, NOT SHIPPING DELAYS.\\n\\nPURCHASING THE PRIORITY EXPRESS UPGRADE IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET COMPENSATED IF YOUR PACKAGE DOES NOT ARRIVE ON TIME. PRIORITY EXPRESS GUARANTEES OVERNIGHT TO 2-DAY SHIPPING, DEPENDING ON SHIP TIME. ADDITIONALLY, PRIORITY EXPRESS ALSO INCLUDES $100 INSURANCE FOR DAMAGED PACKAGES.\\n\\nBY PLACING AN ORDER, YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING AND AGREEING TO THESE TERMS.\\n_______________________________________________________________\\n\\nThis listing is for a READY TO PRESS SUBLIMATION TRANSFER. This is not a digital product nor a completed shirt.\\n\\nPlease make sure you are aware of how sublimation transfers work so you’re able to enjoy your transfer 😊\\n\\nDye sublimation requires a heat press—an iron or Cricut EasyPress will not work.\\n\\nSublimation transfers can only be applied to a polyester substrate or garment with at least 50% polyester thread count. The higher the polyester count, the more vibrant the colors will appear. Lower thread counts will result in a faded, vintage look which may fade further after washing. Fabrics or substrates must be light in color for the ink to be visible. White or light gray will give the best color results. Lighter pastel colors may also work but note that the color of the shirt will affect the final color of the ink. INK WILL NOT SHOW UP ON DARK OR BLACK FABRIC.\\n\\nPlease be aware that printers do not print white. Any images with white in the design have no ink and will not transfer any color to the shirt. The white portions of an image will end up being the color of the shirt you press onto.\\n\\nTransfers are printed to order and are not returnable. Special, high quality sublimation paper is used for printing, however ink will appear faded until pressed. Due to differences in screen resolutions, colors may differ slightly from shown on your screen.\\n\\nCUSTOM TRANSFERS available upon request.\\n\\nSIZING\\nPlease make sure to measure your surface before ordering! The sizing options below are suggested, not universal. You should order based on desired look of your completed project.\\n\\nMug: 4”\\nkoozie: 3”\\nPocket: 3.5”\\nInfant: 5-6”\\nToddler: 6-8”\\nYouth: 8-10”\\nAdult: 8-11”\\nAdult XL: 12-15”\\n\\nAll sizes listed are for the longest edge. Wide and height will be proportionate to the design.\\n\\nGENERAL APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS\\nPlace transfer face down on the garment. You may wish to use heat tape to hold the transfer in place. It is recommended to place parchment paper or wax-free butcher paper inside the shirt to avoid ink transfer through the shirt. Additionally, placing parchment/butcher paper on top of the transfer can prevent ink transfer onto your heat press platen.\\n\\nPress at 400 degrees for 60 seconds using medium pressure.\\n\\nRemove paper immediately and allow to cool.\\n\\n*These are general application instructions and may vary depending on your heat press.',\n",

Each cutting board is examined carefully prior to beginning the engraving process. Each board is sanded and finished with a high-quality food grade butcher block conditioner made from mineral oil and natural waxes so the cutting board will be immediately available for use upon arrival.\\n\\nPlease be aware that every cutting board is made from different wood and is unique! Some boards may engrave slightly lighter or darker than the photo shows.\\n***Special note regarding live edge cutting boards*** All live edge cutting boards are unique, so measurements may vary. Each cutting board measures approximately 10 x 17&quot; and a minimum of 1&quot; thick. Each cutting board will be approximately 170 square inches, so the general dimensions will be approximately 10&quot; x 17&quot;, 11&quot; x 16&quot;, 9.5&quot; x 17.5&quot;, etc.',\n",

       "  'description': 'This original handmade print is inspired by Nomansland, a rural area in Hertfordshire where the artist walks her dog. Beautiful in any season, Nomansland has a particular charm and atmosphere in winter. \\n\\nEach print is unique as it is hand-inked each time. The image is created by etching lines in plastic, then inking the plate by hand using oil-based printing inks on gorgeous Fabriano paper, and passing the inked plate through an etching press. Each print comes signed in pencil by the artist. Nomansland would make an ideal gift for friends and family, or a delightful addition to any home decor.\\n\\nPlease note that the print comes unframed. The image area is 6 inches by 6 inches, and will fit a variety of off-the-shelf picture frames.',\n",
