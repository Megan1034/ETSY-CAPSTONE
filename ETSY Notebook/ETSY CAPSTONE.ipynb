       "   'description': 'Capture the special moments in your family&#39;s life with Cohas Milestone Boards. Designed to look like a real chalkboard, the lightweight board features real chalk art images and lettering. The non-porous surface helps prevent staining and can be used again and again, providing a perfect way to commemorate birthdays, events, holidays, and milestones year after year!\\n\\n• Milestone boards are perfect for commemorating special events, moments, and celebrations in your family&#39;s life. This birthday board features a chalkboard style surface with real chalk art. Perfect for making birthday memories, capturing milestone moments, and fun birthday photo shoots!\\n\\n• Features minimal real chalk art, designed as an add-your-own-style board. Artwork is simply a few birthday candles as dividers and has been hand-drawn by one of our artists with liquid chalk markers. Very faint writing guidelines help write evenly and straight. Images, text, and lines are embedded into the plastic for a longer life.\\n\\n• Each milestone board has a matte finish, to reduce glare from camera flashes and lighting. The non-porous surface is easy to clean and resists staining when used with recommended markers. Simply clean with water or a gentle cleaner after each use; or hang using Command strips or hook and loops for a keepsake.\\n\\n• Select different marker options or use your own liquid chalk markers for more color options. The board has been tested and approved for high quality chalk markers.\\n    - One White Marker\\n    - Three Pastel Markers (White, Pink, Blue)\\n    - Three Bright Markers (White, Pink, Orange)\\n    - Board only No Markers\\n\\n Regular chalk, Expo, and metallic markers are not recommended.\\n\\n• Three Sizes are available the board is lightweight and easy to hold. Made with a durable plastic, the sign holds up against each use, and features rounded corners and smooth edges that won&#39;t cut or harm little fingers.\\n    - 9x12 Inches\\n    - 12x16 Inches\\n    - 15x20 Inches\\n\\n          Celebrate Your Milestones\\n\\nThis birthday milestone board is perfect for capturing your family&#39;s birthday celebrations and growth. Fill in the blanks with anything you desire!\\n\\n• Write your birthday wishes as a reminder to follow your dreams.\\n• Include your favorite memories from the last year as a way to look back on where you&#39;ve been.\\n• Write your hopes for yourself or your family for the coming year.\\n• Fill in your age, height, and weight to remember where you started at the beginning.\\n• Write your likes and dislikes and see how they change over the year.\\n• Be as silly or serious as you like - the board is what you make it!\\n\\n         Stain Resistant, Cleans Easily\\n\\nThe board features a nonporous surface designed to reduce staining. When used with included or recommended markers, board can be cleaned and used again and again. Simply use water and a sponge or paper towels to wipe away lettering and designs. Or, hang with Command strips or hook and loop adhesive in your home for a keepsake until the next birthday or event.\\n\\nWhen ordered with our premium markers they feature a chisel 6mm tip, perfect for making thick and thin chalk-like lines about 1/8-inches wide. The markers&#39; wet-wipe ink means they will remove easily with water. \\n\\nDO NOT USE regular chalk, Expo and dry erase markers, and metallic chalk markers with this board. Chalk will not work on the board and these markers will cause staining and will damage the board. Use only the markers that come with your board, Cohas provided markers, or wet-wipe markers. Certain brands and colors may cause staining. Test other brand markers before use on board.\\n\\nGentle cleansers, Windex, and other kitchen cleaners can be used on the board. Do not use abrasive cleaners like magic erasers or rough sponges. This will cause damage and scratch the board.\\n\\n         Made with Care, from Cohas to You!\\n\\nReal, Hand-Drawn Chalk Art\\nEach piece of artwork is hand-drawn by our artists and digitized. Characters, lines, text, and other elements on the board are genuine chalk art drawings. Our artists use liquid chalk markers on real chalkboards to create the artwork.\\n\\nLightweight and Flexible\\nCohas Milestone Boards are made with a lightweight and flexible solid plastic. They will bend easily, and will not snap, crease, or deform during normal use. Even the largest milestone board is light enough for the littlest of hands.\\n\\nRound, Smooth Corners\\nEach board is made and cut with care! Corners of the boards are round and smooth. They have been stamped round to avoid scratching skin. Edges of the plastic board are cut cleanly to help avoid scraping little fingers.\\n\\nMatte Finish\\nThe chalkboard background and all art are embedded into the plastic to create a long-lasting piece. The surface of the board features a matte finish, which helps reduce glare from camera flashes or lighting equipment.\\n\\n\\nCertified Safe\\nMaterials used in the manufacturing of the board are GREENGUARD Gold Certified by UL (Underwriter Laboratories). This means that the materials are safe for use in environments like schools, food service industries, and healthcare facilities.\\n\\nCertified Nontoxic\\nOur markers, when included, conform to ASTM D-4236 and bear the AP Seal. This means that they have been evaluated by a toxicologist and deemed nontoxic. Markers also bear the CE mark and meet Toy Safety Regulation EN-41.\\n\\nMade in the USA\\nWe proudly source, hand craft, and promote products made in the United States of America. All materials used in the board were made in the USA. The board and materials were designed, printed, and assembled in the USA. Markers and other add-on items may be imported.',\n",

       "   'description': 'These great beads are made by the Krobo People of Ghana, Africa. Powder glass beads are made by crushing glass to a fine powder and heating it so that the particles fuse together. The glass is then poured into clay molds, with a cassava leaf stem used to make the hole. They are baked in an oven and the glass fuses and the cassava stem burns up. This technique has been used in Africa for centuries. Exact mix of beads may vary slightly from photo.\\n\\nBead Size: 14mm diameter\\nStrand Length: 24&quot;\\nApproximate # of Beads: 40-45\\nHole Size: 3mm\\n\\n***** MORE RECYCLED GLASS BEADS AVAILABLE *****\\nBrowse our Etsy store for thousands of other ethnic beads.

USE CODE: 25OFF AT CHECKOUT***\\n***Please ensure that you have read our plant description & shop announcements before purchasing***\\n**We do not ship this plant internationally, or to the states of Alaska and Hawaii**\\n\\n\\nWhat you will Receive:\\nYour 2.5”-6” starter plant will be securely wrapped with soil and a moist paper towel for safe shipping. Each order must contain at least 2 starter plants. The plants purchased do not need to be the same, you may choose any 2+ starter plants that we offer in our shop. Every order will receive Priority Shipping through USPS. Most orders should reach their destination within 1-3 business days after being shipped, but may take longer on occasion. Please note that Tropical Sprouts & USPS cannot guarantee these delivery times. Orders that do not meet the 2-plant minimum will be canceled.\\n\\nPlant Description:\\nPerhaps one of the most iconic tropical fruits, pineapple varieties are a wonderful addition to any landscape. This particular variety produces succulent fruit with amazing flavor. Its long, heavily tapered leaves each end in a dramatic point. The leaves start off brightly green but as the plant fruits, the leaf tops take on a red-orange hue, particularly around the base of the fruit. The pineapple itself is a visual delight as it sports vibrant greens and fiery red tips. Not only will this plant produce delicious fruit but its unique coloring adds dimension to any landscape. \\n\\nEach plant is inspected to ensure that it meets our health & size requirements before being shipped. \\n\\nReplacements & Refunds: \\nPlease note that it is normal for a shipped plant to arrive with a yellow/dead leaf or two. Shipping may cause the plant some stress; Tropical Sprouts does our best to minimize that stress by shipping each plant 1-3 day Priority. Once settled in your home, your plant(s) should have new growth and be thriving within a few weeks! We have found that the plants can bounce back very quickly. However, if your plant has arrived damaged, has completely died, or if you have any other concerns regarding the plant’s health please notify us within 24 hours of USPS delivery. Please provide at least 1 image of the plant in its original packaging that clearly shows the issue. Once we have been notified, we may ask that you give the plant extra care & time to see if it recovers, and/or we may offer you a replacement/refund. Tropical Sprouts is not responsible for any plants that have been removed from their original wrapping and/or if 24 hours have passed since USPS delivery. We are more than welcome to help with any questions you may have regarding plant care!\\n\\nCancellation Policy: \\nIf you need to cancel your order, please message us before your order has shipped and we can cancel it for you. Once an order has been shipped, we are unable to cancel.\\n\\nReturn Policy: \\nTropical Sprouts does not accept returns on any of our plants once they leave our facility.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Laura Bush Petunia\\nPetunia X violacea (Solanaceae)\\n50 seed pack\\n\\nA hybrid between VIP and old fashioned petunia which was born and bred in Texas. Has fragrant violet flowers and does well even in alkaline soils. A hardy, reseeding annual variety native to South America. This rugged old-fashioned petunia variety was bred for its heat and cold tolerance and disease resistance. The Laura Bush Petunia scoffs at extreme summer temperatures, producing numerous 1-1 1/2 inch bell-shaped violet colored flowers. As the mercury rises in the dog days of summer, this baby literally cranks out the blooms. As an added bonus the dark green foliage serves as a background to compliment the vibrant flowers that practically glow. Prefers full sun in well-drained, fertile soil. Very low maintenance and quite impressive.\\n\\nAverage planting success with this species: 80%\\nHeight: 18-24 inches\\nGermination: 15-30 days\\nOptimum soil temperature for germination: 68F-86F\\nSowing depth: Surface Sow\\nBlooming period: April-First Frost\\nAverage seeds per pound: 6,549,000\\nSeeds/Pkt: 200\\nSeeding rate: 1 lb. per acre\\n1 Pkt Covers: 30 sq. ft.\\nSuggested use: Wooden barrels, borders, hanging baskets.\\nMiscellaneous: Flowers are delightfully fragrant. Reseeds. If started in flats, space transplants 12 inches apart. Soil temperatures below 68F will limit germination response. Requires a minimum of 7 hours of direct sun or plants will become spindly and have fewer blooms.',\n",
