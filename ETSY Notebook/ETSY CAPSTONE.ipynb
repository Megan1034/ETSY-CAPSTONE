       "   'description': '&gt;THIS LISTING IS FOR SUBLIMATION TRANSFER ONLY – READ FULL DETAILS BEFORE ORDERING&lt;&lt;\\n\\nOur transfers come ready to heat press and will not have water-markings. BRKreationsBoutique takes pride in using only the highest quality sublimation printer inks and paper. They have been tested and proven to provide the best quality prints onto sublimation materials when applied properly. This is a great alternative to using vinyl! No more weeding or buying vinyl! HEAT PRESS IS REQUIRED - CANNOT USE IRON.\\n\\n📌Sublimation can be done on LIGHT colored fabric, containing at least 65% polyester. The higher the polyester count, the better!\\n\\n📌 TO ORDER\\n•Choose Transfer Size\\n-Youth 7” - 8”\\n-Adult 8.5” - 11”\\n\\n**ASK FOR BULK ORDER PRICES**\\n\\nThese measurements are an estimate and might vary slightly. This measurement will be for the widest part of the image. If you have any questions or want to order a custom size, or design, message us!\\n\\n📌DISCLAIMER\\nPlease do your research on sublimation prior to ordering as we are not responsible for any pressing errors. If done correctly, you image will be bold and vibrant. If your image is faded or washes out, you did not follow instructions. Colors may vary slightly from monitor. This listing is for SUBLIMATION transfers only. (NOT SCREEN PRINTS)\\n\\n📌RETURNS/EXCHANGES\\nDue to the nature of the product, we do not allow returns or exchanges. If there is an issue with your order, please contact us within 5 days of receiving your order! It is your responsibility to look over prints before pressing.\\n\\n📌Most transfers ship SAME or NEXT day! We are not responsible for shipping delays.\\n\\nHave question? Message us! We are happy to help.The initial print coming out of the printer and to you may be dull and looks faded.\\n\\nIt is important to note that this is perfectly fine and in fact shows us that we are on the right track. \\n\\nThe reason for this dull or faded looking print coming out of your printer is that sublimation ink is only activated at 392 degrees Farenhieht , and when placed under sufficient pressure. In other words, the correct colour will only appear on the final sublimated product – after you have completed the sublimation process carefully.\\n\\nCHANGES/CUSTOMS\\nI am not able to make changes or edits to any designs. All designs are sold as-is and should remain that way. There should be no editing of the files to change colors, add or remove items, or change the text. Also, I am not able to do custom orders at this time.',\n",

You&#39;ll find all sorts of brushes inside: Glitter, Calligraphy, and Lettering Brushes. \\n\\nIf you&#39;re just getting started on Procreate or new to purchasing brushes online, this is a great starter pack -- you&#39;ll get a few fun brushes to play with (who doesn&#39;t want a glitter brush??) and even more beginner-friendly brushes for lettering.\\n\\nThese brushes are all easy to use. There will be a brush for all types of letterers -- if you letter fast, there will be brushes to accommodate a faster stroke.

This artwork is inspired by the rabbinic tradition of ascribing each person a name pasuk- a biblical verse that begins and ends with the first and last letters of one’s name, or otherwise contains one&#39;s name. \\n\\nThis beautifully hand-painted artwork inspires a personal connection to Torah and greatly enriches many life-cycle experiences. \\n\\nThis is a giclee (fine art reproduction) of my original piece of artwork. \\nArtwork is  matted and mounted on acid-free board and packaged in a clear protective sleeve. (Outer dimensions of mat: 16&quot;x20&quot;)\\nAn explanation of the name and the pasuk (verse) is included with the artwork.',\n",

The names of Allah are then cut from 3 mm thick wood sheet and arranged in a circular or sqaure format. Available in black, silver and gold colours. \\n\\nThe artwork has four holes cut out in each corner, which can be used to hang it using nails. PLEASE NOTE NAILS OR ANY OTHER MOUNTING ITEMS ARE NOT INCLUDED. This listing and price is only for the artwork. \\n\\nPlease note the names are pasted on the plexiglass sheet using glue, so there would be minor glue marks visible on very close inspection. However this would not be obvious when the item is hung as can be seen from the images. There may be slight marks on the plexiglass sheet as well, which again would not be obvious when the item is hung on the wall against a background. \\n\\nUsing laser technology to ensure ultimate precision, these beautiful 3D calligraphy art pieces are manufactured with utmost care and painted and finished by hand to give a quality product. These wall art hangings are guaranteed to stand out and will add a touch of elegance, beauty and culture to any room’s décor.  \\n\\nApproximate dimensions of 60 cm (width), 60 cm (height) and 0.5 cm (depth - 5mm thick) \\n\\nThe wall hangings are lightweight and can easily be hung using standard nails (NOT INCLUDED) using the mounting holes in the corners. Please note there are no hanging loops at the back. This is so that there is no gap between the wall and the artwork and allows the design to sit completely flat against the wall, which enhances it&#39;s appearance \\n\\nOur products are UK based, ensuring quick delivery timeframes, fast response times and great customer service \\n\\nAt Al-Fannan, we are passionate about our products. Our aim is to provide quality items at a reasonable price. \\n\\nFREE TRACKED DELIVERY - Dispatched within 2 working days with Hermes 2-3 day tracked delivery.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Queen Consort, from Reneeissance Colours’ Crown Jewels collection of vegan handmade watercolour paint, is a super sparkly pink holographic watercolor. It is inspired by the Queen Consort’s ring, whose ruby appears pink in photographs. It will show up on both white and black paper, but will require thicker application to appear opaque on white paper. \\n\\nTo best capture the holographic sparkle in a photo or video, use your camera’s flash. All photos and videos in this listing were shot with an iPhone flash, unless stated otherwise.\\n\\nThe Crown Jewels Collection contains a mixture of colourshift, chrome, and holographic watercolours that reflect the dazzling beauty of the Crown Jewels, the alluring symbols of Britain’s monarchy housed at the Tower of London.\\n\\nEvery paint is handmade with love, which means you may notice some air bubbles, bumps, or cracks. This is completely normal and does not affect the quality of the paint. Every quarter pan is filled 3 times and every half pan is filled 4 times to ensure you get the most paint possible, though air bubbles do occasionally occur.\\n\\nOur homemade binder is made with the highest quality gum arabic available. We do not use honey or any other animal products in our paints, so they are vegan-friendly.\\n\\nNot intended for use on skin. Please do not ingest.\\n\\nFor best results, apply 1 to 2 drops of water to the paint and wait a minute, then reactivate the paint with a paint brush.\\n\\nNOTE REGARDING MAGNETS: All paint pans will come with a magnet glued to the bottom. If you do not want a magnet, please let me know in the &quot;Add a note to ReneeissanceColours&quot; section during checkout. \\n\\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING NOTE: I am currently shipping from London, England. I offer affordable international shipping because I want to share my paint with everyone. However, the postal system has been slow and unpredictable lately, so your paints may take longer than usual to reach you. Once I post them, I have no control over how long they take to arrive. International standard shipping does not come with a tracking number. If you would like tracking, please choose the upgraded shipping option.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Does your hand cramp up at the thought of writing your return address 100s of times?  Mine does!  These custom stamps will not only save you from the dreaded hand cramp, but they also add a beautiful touch to your envelopes!  I just love how a stamped return address looks on the back flap of an envelope.  \\n\\nNow with more flexibility!  Choose from either a wood address stamp or a Trodat self-inking stamp, and pick your ink color as well.\\n\\nIf you&#39;re purchasing a wood stamp and you&#39;d like more ink pad color options, additional colors and types of ink pads are available here: https://etsy.me/2MqDe5l\\n\\n----------\\nTIMING\\n----------\\n\\nI pride myself in providing quick and efficient service, and most customers have their stamps in hand within 5-7 business days after ordering (excludes Sat and Sun). Once I receive your order, you will receive a mock-up within 1-2 business days. After the mockup is approved for production, it takes 1-2 days for the stamp to ship. After that, it&#39;s up the post office to deliver to you in a timely manner.\\n\\nAt checkout, you can choose either first-class shipping, which typically takes 5-7 business days (although is sometimes faster!), or you can upgrade to priority mail which takes 2-3 business days depending on your location.  However, these delivery times are not guaranteed by the post office.Does your hand cramp up at the thought of writing your return address 100s of times?  Mine does!  These custom stamps will not only save you from the dreaded hand cramp, but they also add a beautiful touch to your envelopes!  I just love how a stamped return address looks on the back flap of an envelope.  \\n\\nNow with more flexibility!

I personally love the wood stamps, because you can change ink colors at will!  Wood stamps arrive with handle installed.  You can also choose to add on a standard felt ink pad in blue, red, or black!\\n\\nThe self-inking stamps are the highly respected Trodat brand.  Choose from a variety of colorful inks, which will last for up to 10,000 impressions!  Note that you cannot easily change ink colors with self-inking stamps.\\n\\nNext, enter the desired name and address exactly as you&#39;d like it to appear on the stamp. I will contact you within 1-3 business days with a digital proof of your design.\\n\\nOnce you approve your proof, the stamp will be delivered to you in about 5-7 business days!\\n\\nThis stamp is roughly 1&quot;x2.5&quot;, depending on your exact text. Stamp previews shows an accurate size on a 5×7″ envelope.\\n\\n------------------------\\nABOUT MY SHOP\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe purpose of my shop, Fresh Cut Prints is to encourage, send joy, and show love to others through the written word and good old-fashioned snail mail.

       "   'description': '&gt;THIS LISTING IS FOR SUBLIMATION TRANSFER ONLY – READ FULL DETAILS BEFORE ORDERING&lt;&lt;\\n\\nOur transfers come ready to heat press and will not have water-markings. BRKreationsBoutique takes pride in using only the highest quality sublimation printer inks and paper. They have been tested and proven to provide the best quality prints onto sublimation materials when applied properly. This is a great alternative to using vinyl! No more weeding or buying vinyl! HEAT PRESS IS REQUIRED - CANNOT USE IRON.\\n\\n📌Sublimation can be done on LIGHT colored fabric, containing at least 65% polyester. The higher the polyester count, the better!\\n\\n📌 TO ORDER\\n•Choose Transfer Size\\n-Youth 7” - 8”\\n-Adult 8.5” - 11”\\n\\n**ASK FOR BULK ORDER PRICES**\\n\\nThese measurements are an estimate and might vary slightly. This measurement will be for the widest part of the image. If you have any questions or want to order a custom size, or design, message us!\\n\\n📌DISCLAIMER\\nPlease do your research on sublimation prior to ordering as we are not responsible for any pressing errors. If done correctly, you image will be bold and vibrant. If your image is faded or washes out, you did not follow instructions. Colors may vary slightly from monitor. This listing is for SUBLIMATION transfers only. (NOT SCREEN PRINTS)\\n\\n📌RETURNS/EXCHANGES\\nDue to the nature of the product, we do not allow returns or exchanges. If there is an issue with your order, please contact us within 5 days of receiving your order! It is your responsibility to look over prints before pressing.\\n\\n📌Most transfers ship SAME or NEXT day! We are not responsible for shipping delays.\\n\\nHave question? Message us! We are happy to help.The initial print coming out of the printer and to you may be dull and looks faded.\\n\\nIt is important to note that this is perfectly fine and in fact shows us that we are on the right track. \\n\\nThe reason for this dull or faded looking print coming out of your printer is that sublimation ink is only activated at 392 degrees Farenhieht , and when placed under sufficient pressure. In other words, the correct colour will only appear on the final sublimated product – after you have completed the sublimation process carefully.\\n\\nCHANGES/CUSTOMS\\nI am not able to make changes or edits to any designs. All designs are sold as-is and should remain that way. There should be no editing of the files to change colors, add or remove items, or change the text. Also, I am not able to do custom orders at this time.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Natan Name Pasuk Art Print made by Hebrew & English Calligraphy Artist  Sonia Gordon-Walinsky, makes a meaningful Torah gift for Bris, Bar Mitzvah, Graduation, Retirement,  significant job promotion, career change, and other special occasions.\\n\\nProverbs 20:27  begins with the first letter of Natan, ends with the last letter of Natan, and contains the letters of Natan within the pasuk (verse).\\n\\nPasukART is Sonia Gordon-Walinsky’s unique creation of Torah artwork that connects an individual’s name with a pasuk (biblical verse). This artwork is inspired by the rabbinic tradition of ascribing each person a name pasuk- a biblical verse that begins and ends with the first and last letters of one’s name, or otherwise contains one&#39;s name. \\n\\nThis beautifully hand-painted artwork inspires a personal connection to Torah and greatly enriches many life-cycle experiences. \\n\\nThis is a giclee (fine art reproduction) of my original piece of artwork. \\nArtwork is  matted and mounted on acid-free board and packaged in a clear protective sleeve. (Outer dimensions of mat: 16&quot;x20&quot;)\\nAn explanation of the name and the pasuk (verse) is included with the artwork.',\n",

The current processing time is 1-2 working days, plus shipping time, which is 3-5 working days days for UK orders and up to one month for international orders. If you require the bags within 7 working days of ordering, please contact me as soon as possible as I will try to accommodate you.\\n\\nI typically send all items second class. However if you get in touch to let me know they are urgent, I can prioritise your order and we can discuss other options including first class or special delivery.\\n\\nPlease note, I am unable to offer refunds unless the order takes longer than 14 working days to arrive.

The names of Allah are then cut from 3 mm thick wood sheet and arranged in a circular or sqaure format. Available in black, silver and gold colours. \\n\\nThe artwork has four holes cut out in each corner, which can be used to hang it using nails. PLEASE NOTE NAILS OR ANY OTHER MOUNTING ITEMS ARE NOT INCLUDED. This listing and price is only for the artwork. \\n\\nPlease note the names are pasted on the plexiglass sheet using glue, so there would be minor glue marks visible on very close inspection. However this would not be obvious when the item is hung as can be seen from the images. There may be slight marks on the plexiglass sheet as well, which again would not be obvious when the item is hung on the wall against a background. \\n\\nUsing laser technology to ensure ultimate precision, these beautiful 3D calligraphy art pieces are manufactured with utmost care and painted and finished by hand to give a quality product. These wall art hangings are guaranteed to stand out and will add a touch of elegance, beauty and culture to any room’s décor.  \\n\\nApproximate dimensions of 60 cm (width), 60 cm (height) and 0.5 cm (depth - 5mm thick) \\n\\nThe wall hangings are lightweight and can easily be hung using standard nails (NOT INCLUDED) using the mounting holes in the corners. Please note there are no hanging loops at the back. This is so that there is no gap between the wall and the artwork and allows the design to sit completely flat against the wall, which enhances it&#39;s appearance \\n\\nOur products are UK based, ensuring quick delivery timeframes, fast response times and great customer service \\n\\nAt Al-Fannan, we are passionate about our products. Our aim is to provide quality items at a reasonable price. \\n\\nFREE TRACKED DELIVERY - Dispatched within 2 working days with Hermes 2-3 day tracked delivery.',\n",

Between the stamp motif and the stamped wood, a resilient cellular rubber layer is applied, which ensures better stamping results.\\n\\nEven the unmounted stamp is already provided with a permanently adhesive cell rubber layer. This has a thin protective paper, which can be easily removed to stick the stamp on a piece of wood of their own choice.\\n\\nTo get some inspiration on how to use the stamps by Emadam - Because I love Paper visit me on my youtube channel:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYM6FzufiNNxkB7KCv0WUsA/featured\\nor check out my Instagram account:\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/emadam.de/',\n",

       "   'description': 'Queen Consort, from Reneeissance Colours’ Crown Jewels collection of vegan handmade watercolour paint, is a super sparkly pink holographic watercolor. It is inspired by the Queen Consort’s ring, whose ruby appears pink in photographs. It will show up on both white and black paper, but will require thicker application to appear opaque on white paper. \\n\\nTo best capture the holographic sparkle in a photo or video, use your camera’s flash. All photos and videos in this listing were shot with an iPhone flash, unless stated otherwise.\\n\\nThe Crown Jewels Collection contains a mixture of colourshift, chrome, and holographic watercolours that reflect the dazzling beauty of the Crown Jewels, the alluring symbols of Britain’s monarchy housed at the Tower of London.\\n\\nEvery paint is handmade with love, which means you may notice some air bubbles, bumps, or cracks. This is completely normal and does not affect the quality of the paint. Every quarter pan is filled 3 times and every half pan is filled 4 times to ensure you get the most paint possible, though air bubbles do occasionally occur.\\n\\nOur homemade binder is made with the highest quality gum arabic available. We do not use honey or any other animal products in our paints, so they are vegan-friendly.\\n\\nNot intended for use on skin. Please do not ingest.\\n\\nFor best results, apply 1 to 2 drops of water to the paint and wait a minute, then reactivate the paint with a paint brush.\\n\\nNOTE REGARDING MAGNETS: All paint pans will come with a magnet glued to the bottom. If you do not want a magnet, please let me know in the &quot;Add a note to ReneeissanceColours&quot; section during checkout. \\n\\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING NOTE: I am currently shipping from London, England. I offer affordable international shipping because I want to share my paint with everyone. However, the postal system has been slow and unpredictable lately, so your paints may take longer than usual to reach you. Once I post them, I have no control over how long they take to arrive. International standard shipping does not come with a tracking number. If you would like tracking, please choose the upgraded shipping option.',\n",

       "   'description': 'This tin includes 8 quarter pans of Reneeissance Colours’ Afternoon Tea Collection of pastel chrome watercolours. Each paint in the collection is named after a famous afternoon tea spot in London. You will receive:\\n\\nSketch: pink\\nThe Dilly: copper orange\\nThe Ritz: gold\\nFortnum & Mason: mint green\\nAqua Shard: pale blue\\nDorchester: lilac purple\\nOne Aldwych: chocolate brown\\nBerkeley: cream\\n\\nThe lid of the tin includes a printed swatch card if requested.  \\n\\nPaint pans come with magnets attached to the bottom to help them stay in the tin. \\n\\nOur homemade binder is made with the highest quality gum arabic available. We do not use honey or any other animal products in our paints, so they are vegan-friendly.\\n\\nEvery paint is handmade with love, which means you may notice some air bubbles, bumps, or cracks. This is completely normal and does not affect the quality of the paint. Every quarter pan is filled 3 times to ensure you get the most paint possible, though air bubbles do occasionally occur.\\n\\nNot intended for use on skin. Please do not ingest.\\n\\nFor best results, apply 1 to 2 drops of water to the paint and wait a minute, then reactivate the paint with a paint brush.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING NOTE: I am currently shipping from London, England. I offer affordable international shipping because I want to share my paint with everyone. However, the postal system has been slow and unpredictable lately, so your paints may take longer than usual to reach you. Once I post them, I have no control over how long they take to arrive. International standard shipping does not come with a tracking number. If you would like tracking, please choose the upgraded shipping option.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Does your hand cramp up at the thought of writing your return address 100s of times?  Mine does!  These custom stamps will not only save you from the dreaded hand cramp, but they also add a beautiful touch to your envelopes!  I just love how a stamped return address looks on the back flap of an envelope.  \\n\\nNow with more flexibility!  Choose from either a wood address stamp or a Trodat self-inking stamp, and pick your ink color as well.\\n\\nIf you&#39;re purchasing a wood stamp and you&#39;d like more ink pad color options, additional colors and types of ink pads are available here: https://etsy.me/2MqDe5l\\n\\n----------\\nTIMING\\n----------\\n\\nI pride myself in providing quick and efficient service, and most customers have their stamps in hand within 5-7 business days after ordering (excludes Sat and Sun). Once I receive your order, you will receive a mock-up within 1-2 business days. After the mockup is approved for production, it takes 1-2 days for the stamp to ship. After that, it&#39;s up the post office to deliver to you in a timely manner.\\n\\nAt checkout, you can choose either first-class shipping, which typically takes 5-7 business days (although is sometimes faster!), or you can upgrade to priority mail which takes 2-3 business days depending on your location.  However, these delivery times are not guaranteed by the post office.Does your hand cramp up at the thought of writing your return address 100s of times?  Mine does!  These custom stamps will not only save you from the dreaded hand cramp, but they also add a beautiful touch to your envelopes!  I just love how a stamped return address looks on the back flap of an envelope.  \\n\\nNow with more flexibility!  Choose from either a wood address stamp or a Trodat self-inking stamp, and pick your ink color as well.\\n\\nIf you&#39;re purchasing a wood stamp and you&#39;d like more ink pad color options, additional colors and types of ink pads are available here: https://etsy.me/2MqDe5l\\n\\n------------\\nDETAILS\\n------------\\n\\nFirst, choose either a wood stamp or a self-inking stamp.  I personally love the wood stamps, because you can change ink colors at will!  Wood stamps arrive with handle installed.  You can also choose to add on a standard felt ink pad in blue, red, or black!\\n\\nThe self-inking stamps are the highly respected Trodat brand.  Choose from a variety of colorful inks, which will last for up to 10,000 impressions!  Note that you cannot easily change ink colors with self-inking stamps.\\n\\nNext, enter the desired name and address exactly as you&#39;d like it to appear on the stamp. I will contact you within 1-3 business days with a digital proof of your design.\\n\\nOnce you approve your proof, the stamp will be delivered to you in about 5-7 business days!\\n\\nThis stamp is roughly 1&quot;x2.5&quot;, depending on your exact text. Stamp previews shows an accurate size on a 5×7″ envelope.\\n\\n------------------------\\nABOUT MY SHOP\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe purpose of my shop, Fresh Cut Prints is to encourage, send joy, and show love to others through the written word and good old-fashioned snail mail.

Refunds/Cancellations/Exchanges are not accepted due to lack of reading description and Listing Title. \\n\\n&gt;THIS LISTING IS FOR SUBLIMATION TRANSFER ONLY – READ FULL DETAILS BEFORE ORDERING&lt;&lt;\\n\\nOur transfers come ready to heat press and will not have water-markings. BRKreationsBoutique takes pride in using only the highest quality sublimation printer inks and paper. They have been tested and proven to provide the best quality prints onto sublimation materials when applied properly. This is a great alternative to using vinyl! No more weeding or buying vinyl! HEAT PRESS IS REQUIRED - CANNOT USE IRON.\\n\\n📌Sublimation can be done on LIGHT colored fabric, containing at least 65% polyester. The higher the polyester count, the better!\\n\\n📌 TO ORDER\\n•Choose Transfer Size\\n-Youth 7” - 8”\\n-Adult 8.5” - 11”\\n\\n**ASK FOR BULK ORDER PRICES**\\n\\nThese measurements are an estimate and might vary slightly. This measurement will be for the widest part of the image. If you have any questions or want to order a custom size, or design, message us!\\n\\n📌DISCLAIMER\\nPlease do your research on sublimation prior to ordering as we are not responsible for any pressing errors. If done correctly, you image will be bold and vibrant. If your image is faded or washes out, you did not follow instructions. Colors may vary slightly from monitor. This listing is for SUBLIMATION transfers only. (NOT SCREEN PRINTS)\\n\\n📌RETURNS/EXCHANGES\\nDue to the nature of the product, we do not allow returns or exchanges. If there is an issue with your order, please contact us within 5 days of receiving your order! It is your responsibility to look over prints before pressing.\\n\\n📌Most transfers ship SAME or NEXT day! We are not responsible for shipping delays.\\n\\nHave question? Message us! We are happy to help.The initial print coming out of the printer and to you may be dull and looks faded.\\n\\nIt is important to note that this is perfectly fine and in fact shows us that we are on the right track. \\n\\nThe reason for this dull or faded looking print coming out of your printer is that sublimation ink is only activated at 392 degrees Farenhieht , and when placed under sufficient pressure. In other words, the correct colour will only appear on the final sublimated product – after you have completed the sublimation process carefully.\\n\\nCHANGES/CUSTOMS\\nI am not able to make changes or edits to any designs. All designs are sold as-is and should remain that way. There should be no editing of the files to change colors, add or remove items, or change the text. Also, I am not able to do custom orders at this time.\\n\\nCHANGES/CUSTOMS\\nI am not able to make changes or edits to any designs. All designs are sold as-is and should remain that way.

       "   'description': 'If you&#39;re a parent, you know that from time to time, our children need an attitude adjustment. Teaching them to choose the higher ground in a difficult situation is a worthy goal. Even if we fail as adults, our hope is that we can instill better character building attitudes and practices in our sons and daughters. If you&#39;re a teacher, a coach, an advocate, or another concerned adult who knows someone facing a choice, you want to offer help, but finding the right words is often a struggle. The examples cited here might help clarify a situation. The document has been printed on a creamy textured paper and put into an amazing 8&quot; x 10&quot; ornate painted ivory frame, with its flourishing textured design highlighted in a pearlescent paint. The backdrop is a beautiful golden sky, with lots of wonderful billowy clouds, all in shades of golds and creams. Included are glass and easel backing, so it&#39;s ready to be displayed on a table, desk, or wall. \\n\\nCUSTOM ORDERS\\nDo you see a message you like.. but not the frame that comes with it? See a printed border you like better on a different item? A different font? Do you want just the print without a frame? I can make the adjustments you need! There are two options for submitting a custom order:\\n\\n1) Go through my shop and check out the other items. See another frame you like? A font you like better? A design/art you rather have? Do you want to make a change in words.. or have different text completely you want me to use? What about a short personalized inscription inserted at the top or the bottom? Anything can be done! Click on the &quot;request custom order&quot; button and let me know the frame, design/art, etc. you want me to use with this message. \\n\\n2) If you&#39;re not sure I have the frame or design/art, etc. you want, just click on \\n&quot;contact seller&quot;, and let me know what kind of frame or design you have in mind! I might have something that isn&#39;t in the shop. \\n*In both cases, once you let me know what kind of customization you need, I&#39;ll send you a proof of concept for you to approve.. before making the item physically; that way we can both be sure I&#39;m getting you exactly what you want!\\n\\n\\nRETURNS/EXCHANGES\\nIf ever you&#39;re unhappy with a purchase, it will be replaced.\\n\\nSHIPPING\\nYour purchase will ship in 1-3 business days. If you need it sooner, please specify on your order. (An extra day may be required with larger multiple-frame orders.) Domestic packages are normally shipped USPS Priority Mail (2-3 day delivery) and most international packages- USPS First Class (delivery time depends upon the country of destination). \\n\\nFUTURE FRAMES\\nIf you have any special requests for frames you don&#39;t currently see in my shop, please let me know. I&#39;m always looking for ideas.\\n\\nWHOLESALE PRICING\\nWholesale pricing is available. Please contact me at swarwick03 [!at] gmail.com.\\n\\nUSAGE RESTRICTIONS\\nThe purchase of a frame does not transfer rights to sell, copy or distribute in any way.',\n",

       "   'description': 'We have created these letter bundles for our ephemera lovers. Assorted vintage letters, folded notes and such primarily from France in 5 piece bundles. No two are alike. They are all assorted and each piece can contain a letter of some sort or possibly an invoice receipt or billing statement. Some can have postcards which were mailed in the envelope and or pictures. Some are ripped and some are torn. Some have stamps on them and some do not. A large portion are from a single family household and they must have been saving these for YEARS. Please note that we DO NOT open all the envelopes to see what is inside. We buy these from our French pickers in bulk lots so we can get thousands at a time. We just thought these would be great for mixed media, scrapbooking and art projects.  We bundle them with string and put them in a cello sleeve.\\n\\nPLEASE - NO SPECIAL REQUESTS.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE THESE ARE NOT REPRODUCTIONS SO THERE IS WEAR AND TEAR COMMENSURATE WITH AGE. WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT IT IN EACH ENVELOPE. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU NEED MINT PIECES FOR YOUR ARTWORK. \\n\\nPlease email us if you have any questions.',\n",

No discoloration.\\n\\nPaper weight ( thickness ): 116gsm. We do not use paper weight under 100gsm - which is too soft and difficult to shape.\\nFor each pack: 1 color with 40 strips.\\nSingle paper strip length: 15.35 inches (390mm)\\n\\nThere are total 84 colors to choose from while this listing only includes Color No.1---No.50 due to variations maximun limits.For 1.5mm Color No.51---No.84,please visit another listing:\\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/879334071/15mm-quilling-paper-strips84-colors-to?ref=ss_listing\\n                                \\nApplications: \\nSuitable for adults and kids to create free crafts to decorate  home, office, party,or as a wedding, birthday,anniversary gift to friends,girs,seniors. Or just diy fun!\\n\\nHow to order\\nThere are 2 ways to place an order,either will do:\\n(1) One by one  ( Apply to any purchase, very simple,the unit price $1.43 is slightly higher than that of bulk orders - $1.31):\\nFirst,  in &quot;Color Number&quot; option,select your FAVORITE color from the GREEN NUMBER in the 84-colors picture,or UPPER NUMBER in the color cards picture( they are the same).\\nThen, in &quot;1 pack or 5 packs&quot; option, select &quot;1 pack&quot;\\nLast,   in &quot;Quantity&quot; option, choose the number you want to order for this color.\\nRepeat above steps until all items are selected.\\n( Orders with a total quantity less than 5 can only be placed this way.）\\n\\n(2) Bulk order ( For orders reach to 5, unit price is $1.31 ), you could order as following example to save cost: \\nExample: if you want No.7x1,  No.13x6, No.29x3, No.44x9 ( Total 19 ), since 19 =  5 x 3 + 4 , you can do like this:\\nStep1,  in &quot;Color Number&quot; option,choose a RAMDOM color ( such as &quot;Color No.1&quot; )\\n             in &quot;1 pack or 5 packs&quot; option, select &quot; 5 packs&quot; \\n             in &quot;Quantity&quot; option, choose &quot;3&quot;.\\n             Click &quot;Add to cart&quot;.\\nStep2,  back to previous order page and repeat Step 1 while a litte different:\\n             in &quot;Color Number&quot; option,choose a RAMDOM color ( such as &quot;Color No.1&quot; )\\n             in &quot;1 pack or 5 packs&quot; option, select &quot; 1 pack&quot; \\n             in &quot;Quantity&quot; option, choose &quot;4&quot;.\\n             in &quot;Add your personalization&quot;,write &quot;No.7x1,  No.13x6, No.29x3, No.44x9, Total 19 &quot;\\n             Click &quot;Add to cart&quot;.\\nDone.\\nIt means 1 pack of color No.7, 6 packs of No.13, 3 packs of No.13 and 9 packs of No.44. Total 19 packs.I&#39;ll ship items according to your personalization. \\nThe second way is not as complicated as it seems, actually it is simple.The point is that it save money.In the example above, $2.28 could be saved.( (1.43 - 1.31 ) x 19 = 2.28)\\nYou could save more money especially lots of items.\\n(Please note that the sum of the quantity of each color must be equal to the total order quantity.)\\n\\nFor a  set of every color(84 packs,including all 84 colors),here are the listings :\\n\\n1.5mm width strips:\\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/865430520/15mm-quilling-paper-stripsa-set-of-total?ref=related-1&frs=1\\n\\n3mm width strips:\\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/865427828/3mm-quilling-paper-stripsa-set-of-total?ref=related-2&frs=1\\n\\n5mm width strips:\\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/879732431/5mm-quilling-paper-stripsa-set-of-total?ref=shop_home_active_2&frs=1\\n\\n10mm width strips:\\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/865817156/10mm-quilling-paper-stripsa-set-of-total?ref=shop_home_active_1&frs=1\\n\\nIMPORTANT:\\nConsidering about the color difference from different screen,it&#39;s strongly recommended to select more similar color strips 1 time to avoid extra shipping time and costs.\\n\\nAbout instructions:\\nAs there are a lot of instructions about basic quilling for beginners on youtube so I don&#39;t make tutorials any more.\\nHere are two of them ( links behind). Tools are not exactly same as mine but they are similar.\\n\\nTools guide: how to use the tools\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE0zFhg0MZA\\n\\nShapes guide: how to quill different shapes\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCTtpImMwmg\\n\\nNote:\\nThe shipping time for some countries may take 10-20 days due to the impact of COVID-19.

       "   'description': '★The vinyl will not stick to orange-peel or similar heavily textured and bumpy surface. Low-VOC or Zero-VOC &quot;green friendly&quot; paints are problematic and the vinyl does not adhere well. ORACAL (the vinyl we use)  recommends applying to smooth, semi-gloss or gloss enamel paint. If possible, avoid matte finish Latex paints and paints that contain anti-graffiti agents or stain blockers. See our FAQ&#39;s about vinyl for more information.\\n\\n&quot;Love one another as I have love you&quot; John 15:12 - Lettering Vinyl Decal Wall Art Decor - Perfect for applying straight on the wall, or on a wood sign, or anything with a flat non-porous or un-textured surface!\\n,\\nChoose your size and color in the drop down boxes. The color chart is in the pictures. If you don&#39;t see a size option that fits your needs, message me! It&#39;s no problem to make custom sizes. \\n\\n\\nSmall: \\n18 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall\\n\\nMedium:\\n24 inches wide by 6 inches tall\\n\\nLarge:\\n32 inches wide by 8 inches tall\\n\\nExtra Large:\\n42 inches wide by 10.4 inches tall\\n  \\n\\n\\nPhotos are illustrations and are not sized to any scale.\\n\\n+++++++\\nWhat You&#39;ll Receive:\\n\\n- The decal in between the backing paper and already applied transfer tape\\n- Instructions on how to place your decal\\n\\nThe matte vinyl I stock is high quality oracal 631. It is removable. Not reusable. It has a matte finish, meaning it is not shiny. It has the appearance and texture of regular printer paper - but thicker. It has a thickness of 3 mil. It has an outdoor durability of 3 years. Matte will have a painted-on look and blends well into painted surfaces. Extra low and especially zero VOC paints (environmentally friendly) can be problematic. It is recommended that decals are not applied to new paint and to wait about 3 weeks. Decals may leave a slight residue after removal. If the paint is old, some slight damage could occur upon removal.\\n\\n***I advise against applying decals onto orange-peel textured walls, or anything similar that doesn&#39;t offer enough flat surface area for a decal to stick onto. If you are unsure whether your decal will stick, send me a detailed photo of the surface. Please see the FAQ&#39;s at the bottom of this page for more information.\\n\\nPhotos are illustrations and are not sized to scale. Photos depicting props, furniture, lighting, etc. will not be included with the vinyl decal.',\n",

(Yes, seriously.)\\n😍 Over 99% savings\\n🔗 https://www.etsy.com/listing/619003462\\n\\n😉 Pssst, you can also check out my awesome font bundle to create your own crafty files!\\n🔗 https://www.etsy.com/listing/632828095/\\n\\nWHY SUPPORT MY BUSINESS?\\nEvery SVG in my shop is hand lettered and hand drawn! I *don’t* use fonts in my designs! That means it’s 100% my own creation and unique design. \\n\\nThese file sets can be used for a wide variety of items: t-shirt design, coffee mug design, custom tumblers, custom hats, printables, & more!\\n\\nThese handlettered files come in multiple formats: .svg, .dxf, .pdf, .png, and .ai. The design is sold as-is, and is not editable by the customer since it&#39;s a singular piece of artwork -- ie, no fonts are used.\\n\\nAll files will be contained within a .zip download, available once payment is confirmed & no physical item is shipped to you. The design will be rendered in black, and you may change the color at will! Files are prepared on a digital canvas that is between 8-12 inches wide. Vector files may be scaled up or down without the loss of quality. Your purchase does NOT include the listing images or product photography.\\n\\nSoftware to use these files for their intended purpose includes, but is not limited to: Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Design Space (Cricut), Silhouette Studio (Cameo), and Inkscape.\\n\\nLICENSING\\nAll SVG file sets sold in my shop include commercial use when the design is applied to a physical item for sale up to 500 items. Please contact me for large scale production licensing. You may not resell the digital files in any way or any other format.\\n\\nTHAT LEGAL STUFF\\nMy hand lettered designs are protected by copyright laws. It is a crime to steal them for your own use or profit. I’ve poured years of my life into my craft, and I will come after you. :)\\n\\nUnder no circumstances should the files you purchase be transferred to another person, regardless of the license type. You may not share, transfer, e-mail, or send the files you purchase to someone else for their use. You may not resell the digital files in any form, or modify the digital files for resale. You may not trace the digital files, modify, and resell as your own. I maintain the rights to these files & you may not claim it as your own.',\n",

       "   'title': 'Timeless, Elegant Calligraphy Wedding Invitations | Traditional Script Printed Wedding Invitation Suite | Kamryn',\n",
       "   'description': 'This classic and traditional wedding invitation will perfect for your sophisticated wedding with an abundance of elegant calligraphy.  Your invitation suite is ready to be customized and  printed on modern extra thick card stock for a wedding invite  your guests will remember. If the script is too much for you, just let me know and we can take some out! This design is yours to personalize any way you&#39;d like.\\n\\nI&#39;ll take care of the printing and worry about those details so you get the best paper, nothing flimsy!\\n\\nThis set is modern and traditional, and will be sure to impress your guests with it&#39;s classic beauty.\\n\\n✨WHY THESE ARE RIGHT FOR YOU ✨\\nWhen I got married, I was frustrated. I flipped through book after book and nothing was quite right. A lot were almost right and all I wanted to do is combine a few designs together to create something perfect. That&#39;s what I strive to do with each and every wedding that I work with. If you want to merge design elements from 2 suites together, great! If you want to add in a colored envelope or a wax seal or a vellum wrap - we can do that! You&#39;re working one on one with a designer that can change those things to make these uniquely you. I don&#39;t have a limit to the number of revisions you get, that&#39;s not how I want to run my business. We&#39;ll make it perfect.\\n\\n✨EXTRAS THAT ARE ALWAYS INCLUDED ✨\\n- unlimited rounds of proofs\\n- paper swatches mailed out to you if you would like to see your options\\n- complimentary printed proofs (if time allows - they take about 2 weeks)\\n- your address printed on the RSVP envelope\\n- your return address printed on the mailing envelope\\n\\n**printed guest addresses are an additional $0.75\\n✨WHAT MAKES THESE SPECIAL✨\\nMy favorite part of the classic collection is the paper. I&#39;m a bit of a paper snob and I&#39;ve tried all the papers. I have these printed a crisp, 120# Mohawk Superfine cardstock in either white or ivory, OR you can upgrade the invites to a double thick 240# weight for extra luxurious design.\\n\\nDouble thick cardstock is quite literally - twice the thickness. These invitations are printed on 240 lb cardstock with an eggshell texture. They feel luxurious in your hands and will make such a great impression to your guests. Its roughly the thickness of a paper coaster. \\n\\nYou can see all of the designs in the double thick collection here - https://etsy.me/2zuLrjq\\n\\n✨SAMPLES✨\\nSamples are always available and typically ship within 2-3 days. If I&#39;m out of stock I&#39;ll contact you with an updated ship date. Samples will include the invite, info card, RSVP, belly band, envelope liner and samples of both single and double thick paper in white and ivory.\\n\\n✔️HOW TO ORDER\\n1  • • • Payment\\n\\nTo begin an order, select your options from the dropdown menu. \\n\\nIf you have any custom requests that you don&#39;t see from the dropdown menu, please send me a message with details so I can further advise you on any additional costs. \\n\\n\\n2 • • • Provide Your Wording\\n\\nIn the personalization box, please provide the information required to create your proofs including:\\n• full invitation wording exactly as you&#39;d like it on your invitation\\n• custom text for your info card (hotel reservations, booking information, reception information, shuttles, website, etc.)\\n• RSVP date\\n• any custom RSVP text requests\\n• food choices if applicable \\n• RSVP address\\n• mailing envelope return address\\n• what color paper you would like to use (white or ivory)\\n\\nOR\\n\\nFill out the form on my website - https://www.invitedbylamaworks.com/pages/client-wording-form\\n\\nIf you fill out the form, it will walk you through common questions and wording suggestions!\\n\\n3 • • • Proof Approval\\n\\nYou will receive a custom proof of all of your pieces within 2 business days after purchase.

Beautiful in any season, Nomansland has a particular charm and atmosphere in winter. \\n\\nEach print is unique as it is hand-inked each time. The image is created by etching lines in plastic, then inking the plate by hand using oil-based printing inks on gorgeous Fabriano paper, and passing the inked plate through an etching press. Each print comes signed in pencil by the artist. Nomansland would make an ideal gift for friends and family, or a delightful addition to any home decor.\\n\\nPlease note that the print comes unframed. The image area is 6 inches by 6 inches, and will fit a variety of off-the-shelf picture frames.',\n",
