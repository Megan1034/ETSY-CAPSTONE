Font selections, sizes and colours are locked/embedded and cannot be changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINTING\\r\\nThere is no white ink in standard printing. Any designs with white text must be printed on white cardstock. In the chalkboard designs, for instance, the chalkboard background is actually an image printed onto white cardstock; all of the white text is “knocked out” of the image. Any white you see is simply the absence of ink or the paper color itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAPER SELECTION\\r\\nYou should print on a white or off-white cover stock that is at least: 10 PT - 80 lb COVER - 216 G/M2 and that works with your printer. Anything lighter than this could be to flimsy for mailing (specifically for the RSVP postcard). The whiter your paper is, the brighter and truer your colours will print. I don’t recommend printing directly onto metallic-finish, bright, dark or patterned papers but mounting your finished, trimmed invitations onto these papers and leaving a bit of a border can look really polished and high-end. \\r\\n\\r\\nPaper quality makes a difference too - I have found that with cheaper, store-brand papers the ink tends to bleed and result in muddy colors and fuzzy edges. There are some paper companies out there that will provide cheap (or even free) samples to test print with before you commit - so its worth looking around and trying out some samples if you have time.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can find basic card stock at any local office supply, stationery, or craft store. There are also lots of online paper retailers out there with some beautiful papers and envelopes...\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.paper-source.com\\r\\nhttp://www.thepapermillstore.com/card-stock/\\r\\nhttp://www.frenchpaper.com/\\r\\nhttp://www.papercard.co.uk/\\r\\nhttp://www.paperenvelopes.ca/\\r\\n\\r\\n(These websites are offered as EXAMPLES ONLY - to illustrate what you may find by searching online.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAll files and designs are copyright Amy Adams Printables and are for the personal use of the purchaser only.

You will LOVE the quality of our print products; we do not use rubber stamps for printing, but instead use high quality graphics to create metal printing plates and use solid ink and professional equipment for stunning print results. You will be so happy with the difference in quality. \\n\\nWe make each graphic just for you!  Shipping times can still be unpredictable; we will ship your order and the agreed date, but cannot guarantee delivery dates.  Please keep this in mind when ordering and when choosing a shipping preference.  USPS is our standard carrier, but we can also quote UPS expedited services.  In many cases USPS Priority is faster and less expensive than UPS Ground, making it a good choice overall.  However UPS expedited has tracking and can result in fewer days shipment times if the time frame is critical.  Just ask!  Thank you!\\n\\nWe are the gals from PaisleyGreyDesign, InTheClear and InkScissorsPaper and this is our shop devoted to weddings.  We can print on almost anything - and do!  DIYers - you are going to love this!  We are slowly adding products, so check back with us if you don&#39;t find what you need.',\n",

       "  'policy_shipping': 'In most cases, we ship via USPS First Class Mail or First Class International.  Depending on the number of products ordered (thus increasing the weight of the package), we may ship via USPS Priority Mail.  In either case, our shipping software will alert you via email when the item has shipped.  This is typically 10-14 days after you have placed your order if you are ordering custom goods and within 1-3 days if you are ordering supplies. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe do purchase delivery confirmation, but not package tracking services.  If you would like to order tracking service or insurance, please notify us prior to shipping for a quote.  It is typical that each of these services will add approximately $2-3 to the cost of your shipping.  We will happily add them if you choose to upgrade the services.',\n",
       "  'policy_refunds': 'You will receive a proof or series of proofs via convo after you have ordered.  \\n\\nThe first proof or several will be created from the notes you have indicated at checkout and any conversations we have had prior to that time through email.  You may request changes to the design proofs, keeping with the same basic design.  \\n\\nIf you have ordered a custom graphic, we will work together using your thoughts and requests to create the graphic that you desire.  If at any time there are additional charges for design services (which is rare), you will be notified of this in advance.  If you do not agree, you will be given the opportunity to refund your original purchase before we begin the design process. \\n\\nMuch of the work involved with custom printed items is the design and set up for die production and the printing plate itself.  Once the print production stage arrives, much of the work has been completed.  \\n\\nDue to the nature of the product and the fact that it is a fully customized product that cannot typically be used by another person, refunds are not given.  You will receive a proof in advance of print; you will have at least 24 hours to approve or change the design.  Please monitor your Etsy conversations for communications, including print proofs.  If we are editing an existing design, your design will approve as per your checkout notes within 24 hours of the proof being sent to you. If you would like any changes to the design once you receive the proof, please get back to us quickly so that the changes may be made.\\n\\nWe will communicate with you regarding the design used for production.  We will then make a printing plate with the same design.  If we have made an error in production (we used the wrong proof for production or the design/image file is incorrect), we will correct the order at our expense or offer a refund in full.  If the customer has approved the proof with an error, we do not offer reprints at our expense.  We will print the corrected design as a new order.  Please review proofs very carefully in advance of approval.\\n\\n*** The final proof is your opportunity to notify and alert us that there is an error - a misspelling, an incorrect date, incorrect font, etc.  The printed item will use the EXACT graphic that is shown in the proof.  If it is not correct, please do not issue approval.  Please check your proofs very carefully to avoid costly errors.  We are happy to make changes to the design prior to the production process. ***\\n\\nPrint products are not exact and small variations may exists from one piece to the next. Most items print somewhat consistently, however keep in mind that ink may transfer differently from one substrate to the next.  Customers love the quality of our prints and we are confident you will love them with this in mind.\\n\\nOn occassion there will be a delay in production, shipping, or some other problem.  I will notify you as soon as this situation becomes known and will offer you any alternatives that are available.\\n\\nWe ship via USPS Priority Mail most often.  Shipping transit times are estimated and there is no guarantee of delivery date with this type of service.  If your project is date critical, please contact us in advance for RUSH production at $40 (if our schedule allows) and a separate shipping quote using an alternate, tracked service.  We prefer shipping via UPS, however, we can also ship via FedEx in some circumstances.  We agree that the package will ship on or before the listed ship date assigned by Etsy based on our production times. We cannot guarantee shipping times once the package leaves our office.  *** Shipping times are unpredictable and we leave it to the customer to decide whether expedited shipping or a specialty shipping method is required. We will happily obtain a quote for faster or more specific shipping methods for each customer. If we agree to ship your product on a given date, we will do so, however we are not responsible for any delays in shipping caused by the carrier.  We do not accept returns for customized products not delivered on time; we leave the shipping method and payment to the discretion of the customer and agree to ship using the specified method upon receipt of payment. *** In cases involving any default in guarantee by the carrier to deliver on a specific date, we will provide all necessary paperwork required by the carrier regarding the product information and additional information as needed to make any claim.  Please note that during COVID-19, many carriers have suspended guarantees; we leave the shipping decision to the customer.  In absence of a specific request by the customer and a subsequent payment for that shipping method, we will ship the item via USPS Priority mail as our &quot;standard&quot; service.  \\n\\nUPS ORDERS.  We do ship with UPS as well (if the pricing is better or faster than USPS).  We never know in advance whether the customer has released or intends to release a package in advance via UPS My Choice, so we ship assuming the package is insured.  If you have chosen UPS My Choice, this essentially means we are shipping your package without insurance because you have released liability in advance.  Here are the details as provided to us by UPS: Regarding &quot;My Choice Release&quot;: &quot;The consignee/ receiver releases all liability from UPS for the delivery of packages through their My Choice account. That means that the UPS My Choice Member has released UPS from liability for the package even if it&#39;s lost, stolen, or damaged. By selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, it authorizes UPS to release the package to the address when no one is present to receive the delivery. UPS will only make one delivery attempt and will not obtain a signature upon delivery. A UPS delivery record constitutes conclusive proof of delivery and, by selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, the reciever is asked and is required to accept responsibility for any loss or damage to the package after it has been released.&quot;  Keep in mind we do not know at the time of shipment if we should use an alternate shipping method.  If you would like to prevent us from using UPS as a shipping choice (you have or plan to release liability using My Choice), please notify us in the checkout notes so that we can obtain a shipping quote for an alternate shipping method.  We are not responsible for the package in possession of the carrier or after delivery, as we have no control over the package status during the shipment process and at the point of delivery. \\n\\nOur goal is 100% satisfaction and referral business.  We hope you will enjoy your products and share our shop products with your friends and family.',\n",

If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact me at hello@thestamppress.com.\\n\\n✨OPENING HOURS✨\\nWe are in the studio, working on orders and answering all your questions and queries on weekdays between 9am and 5pm. (Our time zone is EST +5hrs).\\n\\nAll emails and order enquiries will be answered by either Amy or myself (Diane). \\n\\nWe really try to respond to all emails within 24hrs.. however this often stretches to 48hrs if we are busy. We are a small and very busy team! If you email us, please bare with us... we absolutely will be back in touch with you as soon as possible.\\n\\nOur weekends are very important to us. We will return all messages received over the weekend early the following week.\\n\\nCUSTOM | PERSONALIZED ORDERS\\nPERSONALIZATION \\nPlease leave your personalization details in the ‘Notes to Seller’ box at checkout. \\n\\nARTWORK / LOGO\\nPlease send your artwork to us by convo and select the ’Attach Image’ wording on the bottom right of the text box. Alternatively you can send the artwork by email to hello@heirloomseals.com. \\nThe preferred file types are; JPEG or PNG but we also accept PDF, AI, PSD and EPS. Please ensure that the file is clear, crisp, high resolution and legible. The larger the file the better... we can edit the size to suit the stamp size.\\n\\nCAN I EDIT FONT / WORDING ON A STAMP?\\nAbsolutely! All of our stamps are completely customizable. Please send us a message and we would be happy to customize the stamp for you!\\n\\nDO YOU PROVIDE PROOFS?\\nWe don’t automatically provide proofs, but would be more than happy to issue one if requested. Please note that issuing proofs may delay the production time.\\n\\nPERSONALIZED STAMPS\\nIf requested, proofs for personalized stamp orders will be issued within 48hrs.\\n\\nCUSTOM STAMP DESIGNS\\nProofs for new custom stamp designs will be issued within 1-2 business weeks.\\n\\nWHICH STAMP TYPE SHOULD I CHOOSE? WOOD | CLEAR | SELF-INKING?\\nWOOD STAMPS\\nThese are great for crafting & DIY projects because of their versatility. They require a separate ink pad and so can be used with many different colors and ink types. They are also great for use with embossing powders.\\n\\nSELF-INKING\\nThese are the fast and precise option. The black ink is built into the stamp. They also make that great &quot;ka-dunk&quot; sound! The ink lasts for approx 10,000 impressions & they can be re-filled when they run out.\\n\\nSTAMP SIZING INFO\\nAll sizes are listed in the listing descriptions as well as the dropdowns in each listing. \\n\\nAll measurements are in inches.\\n\\nIf you are unsure what stamp size you need, we find it can be super helpful to take your tag / card / scrap of paper etc and then roughly draw out the size stamp you would like to a achieve. Then just take a ruler and measure your doodle! \\n\\nHelpful tip : If you are planning to stamp on tags... make sure to factor in the location of the hole for the string when calculating the &#39;stamp-able area&#39;.\\n\\nIf you have any queries AT ALL... please shoot us and email and we will get back to you asap!\\n\\nUH-OH! I USED THE WRONG SHIPPING ADDRESS! WHAT SHOULD I DO?\\nPlease let us know ASAP! (Within 24hrs if possible). We will update the shipping information on our end but please note that we cannot change the address on your actual Etsy Receipt. When we mark the order as ‘Shipped’, the original address will still appear on your Etsy receipt. We will provide you with tracking information for the new address.\\n\\nIf you do not let us know the address is incorrect, we are not responsible if the order is shipped to the wrong address. We will ship to the address on the Etsy receipt, unless otherwise notified.\\n\\nIf the package is returned to us due to an incorrect supplied address, the full shipping rate must be paid again in order to re-send it. We will provide an invoice via Paypal.\\n\\nGIFT WRAPPING | GIFT NOTE | PACKAGING\\nAll our stamps and seals already come with the prettiest of packaging!\\n- Our stamps come packaged in a paper bag with a pretty sticker.\\n- Our wax stamps & embossers come packaged in a cute cotton bag.\\n\\nHowever we do also offer gift wrapping - just select this option at checkout. Gifts are wrapped in kraft paper and tied in a luxury black & white striped ribbon. A little white gift card is also included for gift messages. \\n\\nIf you would like us to mail your stamp/seal direct to the recipient, and/or would like us to include a personalised note… just let us know! :)',\n",

While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. I describe these rights below:\\n\\nAccess: You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information I hold about you by contacting me using the contact information below.\\n\\nChange, restrict, delete: You may also have rights to change, restrict my use of, or delete your personal information.

The requested information will be formatted with the font, casing and layout shown in the listing photos. If you would like any changes (i.e., different capitalization), please make special note of that on your order. We are always happy to adjust designs to create the stamp you have envisioned! Please note that if no other name/address is provided for the stamp, the shipping information will be used.\\n\\nPROOF REVIEW PROCESS\\nIf you request a free proof on your order, it will be sent through the Etsy messaging system. Proofs are normally made within 24 hours (except on the weekends). We are more than happy to make changes to the layout, wording, or even switch to a different listing design option. \\n\\nAfter delivery of the proof, you will have 2 business days to inform us of change requests. If we do not hear from you, we will proceed with your order as shown in the proof based on your order instructions and the purchased design. If you need more time to decide, please just let us know.\\n\\nYou can turn on email notifications in your Etsy account settings if you are concerned about missing the message.\\n\\nSTAMPING TIPS\\nThe biggest factor that will change the look of your stamp is the paper being used. To test the imprint quality of your stamp, use it on plain printer paper.\\n\\nGlossy, metallic, or coated papers: The ink sits on the surface of these papers and will take longer to dry. Too much pressure will make the ink smoosh out (very technical term) while you press down. For a cleaner imprint, apply less pressure. \\n\\nFibrous, textured or artisan paper: If the paper is looser weave, the ink will be able to bleed between the fibers. For a cleaner imprint, stamp a plain piece of paper a few times before stamping on your project paper. This will get some of the ink off the stamp and reduce the paper bleed.\\n\\nDAMAGED DURING SHIPPING\\nWhile we have had a very positive relationship with USPS, every once in a while a package seems to be handled quite brutally. If your order arrives damaged, please simply send us a photo of the item and the packaging within 5 days of the tracking delivery date.',\n",

Please make sure to take note of the item description when making a purchase. For more information about Semi-Custom vs. Custom and Printed vs. Digital Stationery, please read the STATIONERY GUIDE section below.\\n\\n________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nSTATIONERY GUIDE\\n..........................................................................................................................\\n\\nSEMI-CUSTOM vs. CUSTOM - WHAT&#39;S THE DIFFERENCE?\\nSemi-Custom refers to our collection of pre-made designs that we personalize with your information. We offer a wide variety of semi-custom designs in a range of styles, colors, and lettering and calligraphy fonts, allowing you to purchase unique stationery while keeping the cost and timeframe below those of a full custom design. Custom refers to a design or item that we create just for you! Whether you want to modify an existing design and add elements to make it your own, add coordinating items, or build something brand new from scratch, we collaborate together to bring your vision to life. Looking for something in between? Our stationery add-on items like custom designed maps and custom hand lettering are way for you to make your semi-custom stationery one-of-a-kind.\\n\\nPRINTED vs. DIGITAL - WHAT&#39;S RIGHT FOR ME?\\nWe realize that everyone has different preferences, comfort levels, and budget constraints when it comes to wedding and event planning! In an effort to accommodate these needs and maximize flexibility for you, we offer two options for all of our stationery products: 1) Printed Cards that professionally print, assemble, and ship your items to you - no work required! 2) Print-at-Home digital file(s) that we customize with your information and email to you. You can then take that file to a local copy/print shop or print at home. \\n\\n________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nSEMI-CUSTOM STATIONERY GUIDE\\n..........................................................................................................................\\n\\nHOW TO ORDER:\\n1.

Orders for Print-at-Home Stationery: Once you&#39;re happy with the proof(s), the file(s) are ready for you to print as many times as you&#39;d like, at home or at the copy/print shop of your choosing.

Just note in the comments section at check-out if you need a different size or want to print multiple copies of an item per page (an example of this would be if you want to print 2 invitations out per 1 sheet of letter-size paper). Otherwise, the files will be sent to you in the sizes that are noted in the item description. For printed orders, please message us prior to ordering with what size you need and we will send you a quote (pricing may differ from standard sizes noted in the listing).\\n\\nAre stamps included? How much will postage cost?\\n&gt;&gt;  Postage stamps are not included in your purchase. While most invitations can typically be mailed with one standard stamp, we recommend taking one finished, printed invitation/suite to the post office after you receive your order, so that they can weigh it for you.\\n\\nCan I see samples?\\n&gt;&gt;  Yes! We offer individual samples upon request, or a full sample kit for $10 that includes our most popular designs and a variety of different paper types. Message us for more information. \\n\\nCan I see a proof before I place my order? What if I have changes?\\n&gt;&gt;  We cannot send you a customized file with your information until you have submitted an order and your payment has processed. But don’t worry! Edits and most modifications are included complimentary in your purchase. Once your order has processed and you&#39;ve provided us with the details for your design, we&#39;ll email you an electronic proof file for you to review within 1-2 business days. If there is anything about the design that you want to change—spacing, text, size, you name it—just let us know! We’ll send you a revised file ASAP.\\n\\nI have graphic design software, can you just send me the template and I&#39;ll customize it myself?\\n&gt;&gt;  No, we can only send print-ready, non-editable JPEG files (or PDFs upon request) due to license & copyright rules with fonts and illustrations used in our designs. \\n\\nTHE FINE PRINT\\nWe strive to make sure all of our clients completely, totally, 100% satisfied with their products and overall experience (we&#39;ll definitely lose sleep if you aren&#39;t happy)! We try to catch typos, but please note that we create the designs fully off of the information you provide to us. We assume no liability for proofreading or errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, venue names or addresses, dates (days of week, correct year), etc. As such, we strongly advise all clients to thoroughly and fully review the text you provide to us prior to the check-out process, as well as the customized digital proof(s) we email you. We absolutely understand if your wedding planner or future mother-in-law needs to look first - take your time! Just do this prior to approving the proof (or printing yourself). \\n\\n________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nDISCLAIMERS\\n..........................................................................................................................\\n\\n-- All Processing ETAs listed do not include shipping time, which is dependent on the method to be selected by customer at check-out.\\n-- All Processing ETAs assume the client provides all necessary information needed to customize the item(s) prior to check-out. Orders will require additional time if the client does not provide this information when the order is placed. For printed orders, the printing stage of production cannot begin until the individual who placed the order has notified us with approval of the electronic design proof. \\n-- Extensive modifications to the design not discussed prior to the ordering process, and/or edits in excess of more than 3 rounds, will result in additional fees and require additional processing time. \\n-- For orders of digital file(s) and instant download files, we assume no liability for your printing costs at any point, and once the design has been completed and/or downloaded, the order cannot be refunded. For printed orders, once the individual who placed the order has provided us with proof approval, the order cannot be cancelled or refunded. The design cannot be altered without incurring additional new charges. We assume no responsibility for lost or damaged packages.\\n-- Pictures used in listings often include elements (e.g., suite embellishments, postage stamps, upgraded paper, envelope add-ons, invitation backers) that are not included in your purchase. Please review the item description to see what is included.\\n-- Computer screens handle colors differently than printers do, so sometimes they may appear slightly different when printed. Individual samples available upon request. Sample kit sold here.\\n-- All designs are property of Dunkirk Designs. Reproduction is strictly prohibited.',\n",

I very carefully check all work and in the rare instance where I have written something that differs from what you have provided, I will certainly correct it and get it to you as soon as possible.\\n\\nENVELOPES AND PAPER\\nUnfortunately, not all inks and papers get along. Please ask your stationer to use papers that will take calligraphy ink well. If you are unsure, please send me a sample for testing. There are often little tricks we can use to get the desired result.\\n\\nSURCHARGES\\nI am very happy to work with you to match a desired colour. There is a surcharge of £10 per order for colour matching. Some ink colours may incur a small surcharge.\\n\\nDark paper with light ink is a beautiful thing but more difficult to pull off. There is an additional fee of 50p per envelope and 20p per place card to cover the additional time required. Other projects will be priced individually.\\n\\nTHE NATURE OF HAND LETTERING\\nThe beauty of hand written calligraphy is in its imperfection. All the work done at Crouch End Calligraphy is by hand. This means there will be some inconsistencies in letters and spacing. Our final products are always perfectly imperfect.',\n",

I try to recycle shipping materials as much as possible while keeping your order safe and sound. \\r\\n\\r\\nCustom work\\r\\nI love custom work! Please give me as much information up front as possible so the workflow can be as efficient as possible. Custom letterpress is only available in quantities of 20+, or more for certain projects. Quite a lot of set-up costs go into letterpress printing, so if you think you will need to re-order soon, it&#39;s more cost-efficient to order a larger quantity up front.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many things to keep in mind when designing for letterpress. Letterpress truly excels at printing line art. You will get the deepest impression and overall best results from lines between 1-4 points. Large areas of color will not show the impression as well, nor will it be 100% consistent. Very small text or complicated designs may get clogged up with ink and not print well. For more guidelines on designing for letterpress, see: http://www.boxcarpress.com/letterpress/designing-for-letterpress.html\\r\\n\\r\\nAccuracy\\r\\nEach and every piece of paper is placed into the press by hand. This means there will be slight variations from piece to piece — that&#39;s the beauty of handmade! Please allow up to 1/16&quot; variation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimeline\\r\\nLetterpress is a physical process done completely by hand. I cut each piece of paper, print, fold and package everything by hand. Expect even the smallest job to take a minimum of 2-3 weeks, add another week for each additional ink color. \\r\\n\\r\\nWholesale\\r\\nSome Bess Paper Goods & Gifts merchandise is available to purchase for resale.

As I am new here, I am working on getting more listings up as quickly as possible. It has taken me many years to finally get up the courage to share my creativity with the world. I have so many old and new ideas it&#39;s almost a little overwhelming when I think about where to start. On top of that, I am working on learning how to  navigate the Etsy world. \\r\\n     Most of the products you will be seeing in my shop are paper flowers and custom calligraphy work. Please don&#39;t ever hesitate to message me if you need anything customized or personalized. I will gladly collaborate with you to fulfill your vision! Also, when you make a purchase from my shop 5% of the profit from each sale will be donated to help unwanted shelter pets, a cause very near and dear to my heart. As my shop and success grows I hope to eventually increase the donation amount.\\r\\n  I am looking forward to my Etsy journey and working with you in the near future.\\r\\n                                         Thanks for visiting The Calligrapher&#39;s Rose\\r\\n                                                                    Donna',\n",

We seriously appreciate your business!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt PRETTY PEACOCK PAPERIE we love all things pretty. We believe that the happiest girls are the PRETTIEST girls. So, we are committed to providing our gems with a superior service, products and making you HAPPY. If you have any questions about our company you can also refer to our website to get more Q&A Info!\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow you will find a list of my &quot;fuss-free&quot; policies!\\r\\n\\r\\nReturns and Exchanges\\r\\n\\r\\nReturns we do not accept. \\r\\n\\r\\nExchanges must be reported in 5 days. Once you receive your package remove the checklist from the box. Count and make sure that every item is accounted for! I will include the checklist for you. However it is the responsibility of the customer to double check the order upon arrival and in a timely manner. If there is a problem contact me at anytime within 5 days and we will work to fix the issue! Again, I need all my gems to be happy with their order! (Or I seriously can&#39;t sleep at night! And what is a girl without her beauty sleep!)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Is a General guideline for our custom clients:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Semi-Custom Invitations:\\r\\nStep 1: Choose your design. Narrow down your favorite designs and purchase samples. PLEASE NOTE: Samples do not come in your color of choice unless the $20.00 fee is paid per suite. This $20.00 fee is credited back to you should you decide to book with us! Choose your favorite design and Convo me about the quantity and your selection. I will create a listing that you can purchase. So, we can GET THIS PARTY STARTED! \\r\\n\\r\\nStep 2: Choose your wording! We have an extensive selection of wedding wording. (Ask us about wording for other events!) If you have any suggestions feel free to submit your own wording and we would be happy to use it. \\r\\n\\r\\nStep 3: Approve your proofs. We then gather all of your selections and create your digital proof. All proofs have to be approved by the client. All clients must sign the PROOF APPROVAL FORM. We suggest that you go through all wording very carefully. We also recommend that all clients have a third party read the invitation and all wording. I cannot stress how important this step is and how seriously it should be taken. Please read the proof and re-read it several times! Once we begin production we can no longer make changes. ::Bummer I know!::\\r\\n\\r\\nStep 4: Production. We go into production for your invitations. All invitations that go into production at the beginning of the business day will be shipped out within 3-5 business days. We pride ourselves on including our customers in the process. A courtesy email is sent out every step of the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nStep 5: Check your order. A checklist is provided with every order. Please check the contents to ensure that all pieces are accounted for. All issues with orders, if there are any, must be reported within 5 days. \\r\\n\\r\\nStep 6: Leave feedback! We love to hear from our customers! Hopefully we have made you completely HAPPY during the process and you want to scream your love for us from the rooftops! Yup, hopeless romantic over here! \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have any questions, no worries, hit the convo button girl!\\r\\n\\r\\nXOXO,\\r\\n\\r\\nNat',\n",

I will send you online proofs throughout the process allowing you to make changes until everything is perfect. This takes about 1-2 months.\\n\\n04 | MAIL: The BEST day! Everything is double checked & to you in about 3 days.\\n\\nWHAT ARE THE PERKS WHEN WORKING WITH A CUSTOM STATIONER?\\n01 | TIME SAVER\\n02 | MONEY GOES FURTHER\\n03 | TECHNICAL STUFF\\n04 | THE WOW FACTOR\\n\\nHOW CAN A STATIONERY SAVE YOU TIME?\\nI remember planning my own wedding – I convinced myself I would do (almost) everything DIY to save money – and I did! But it came at a cost: TIME! I wasted so much time trying to get everything perfect turning this fun life experience into a chore! I don’t want this for you – so please delegate where you feel comfortable! The process will feel more enjoyable and come with a lot less headaches.\\n\\nInvesting in a calligrapher is a big time-saver and one thing you can cross off your to do list for good! Leaving you feeling confident that the end result will be something beautiful that represents you as a coupe!\\n\\nBUT CUSTOM STATIONERY IS SO EXPENSIVE, HOW CAN IT MAKE YOUR MONEY GO FURTHER?\\nMy grandma always told me “good things come in small packages”! That is how I view calligraphy - that little detail that makes a big & lasting impression! Your guests may not remember your shoes or the table linen; but they will remember seeing their name written beautifully on their envelopes or place cards.\\n\\nWhen comparing your calligrapher to all your other vendors, it is likely to be the least expensive vendor with one of the biggest impacts! Your guests will leave feeling that you thought about every detail – including them! Your photographer and you will be thrilled how this simple detail elevated your photos. Lastly, a calligrapher is vendor you can continue to use even after your wedding day…holiday cards, birth announcements, etc.\\n\\nBUT A DIY TEMPLATE SEEMS EASIER....\\nThere is more that goes into your wedding stationery than just the text or hand lettering on the invitation. Such as finding a quality printer, selecting the best paper type, understanding the printer’s terminology so your invitation prints properly, address etiquette, sourcing your envelopes, and more.\\n\\nInstead of taking a crash course in the printing process (everyone’s favorite activity while planning a wedding), why not hire a calligrapher who has this down to a science? Hiring a calligrapher will be more efficient, will keep your timeline on track, will save you countless hours reading about the printing process, and will save wasted ink, paper, and paper jams! Leave it to the professional to get it perfect!\\n\\nTELL ME MORE ABOUT THE WOW FACTOR\\nYour wedding day is one of the most wonderful days of your life and every detail deserves special attention.\\n\\nWhat other event in your life will you have the opportunity to showcase you as a couple? None. So why not have fun planning the details and wow your guests with custom invitations!',\n",

       "  'announcement': 'With my own handwriting and the beautiful smile of my boston terrier Bandit, I created Sidesandwich Paper Co. on my 30th birthday, Nov 1st, 2015, by opening my Etsy shop.  I had always wanted to make greeting cards; the way you can brighten someone&#39;s day with your own words and unique handwriting, creating a tangible keepsake, it always stayed with me from childhood. With the love & support of Bandit and Tootalltom inspiring LOVE and GRATITUDE cards left and right, Sidesandwich was born.\\n\\nOur goal is to encourage others to be themselves, give more love & thanks and scatter more joy in the universe. I create, print and handfold each card in my home studio. I found that making something with my hands, using recycled materials, incorporating dance & music - is all helping me battle my anxiety and depression (more prevelant after the passing of B in 2017 to eye cancer). Art is a wonderful healer and I look forward to days in my studio to create. Each order is made with love and sent with hopes that my simple paper vessel will go forth and create even more joy to those you love. \\n\\nI want to also encourage girls to be excited about space, science, love, friendships, maybe starting a business of their own. I want to support education, keep handwriting alive and help others share their unique voice. Let&#39;s help each other talk about mental health and remove the stigma around it. Sometimes the right words are hard to say, maybe one of my awkward cards can help bridge the gap and open the lines of communication. \\n\\nThank you for checking us out and supporting small business. Be safe, be kind and scatter more joy in the world &lt;3\\n\\n\\n\\n** Orders have been going out as usual for now during this COVID-19 crisis. I hope you all are safe and well. If orders are delayed due to a delay in supply orders, I will update you right away and can issue a refund as well if needed - we&#39;ll just make sure to communicate :) Thanks in advance for your understanding and as I try to stay open during this pandemic &lt;3**\\n\\n\\nSidesandwich Paper Co.  |  Folded Funny\\n\\nSideSandwiches aren&#39;t just greeting cards. They&#39;re folded moments of a unique comedy voice that are sure to make you smile. And if you don&#39;t like smiling?  there&#39;s a cute dog. \\n\\nThings are off center, uneven, often pixelated to feel ALIVE.

You may also choose to provide me with additional personal information (e.g., for a custom order), if you contact me directly. I will only use your information to fulfill your order, to settle disputes, or to provide customer support. I share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you my services and comply with my obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use. I retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with my services and as described in my Privacy Policy. However, I may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce my agreements.\\n\\nI DON&#39;T SEE WHAT I&#39;M LOOKING FOR IN YOUR SHOP. DO YOU ACCEPT COMPLETELY CUSTOM ORDERS?\\nI love custom orders! If you cannot find what you are looking for in my shop, message me via Etsy or email me at hello [at] letterbcalligraphy [dot] com.\\n\\nWHAT IF I NOTICE ERRORS OR NEED CHANGES?\\nYou are responsible for providing Letter B Calligraphy and Design with correct and accurate information. I will rely solely on the information provided by you to complete the services. It is within my sole discretion as to whether I correct an error, and/or whether I do so for an additional charge. \\n\\nI recommend that you double check any text or information you send when submitting your order to prevent any errors or extra rounds of revision.\\n\\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR MODERN MONOLINE OPTION AND YOUR MODERN CALLIGRAPHY OPTION?\\nMy modern monoline style is done using a gel pen and the letters are all the same stroke weight. In other words, there are no variations from upstrokes or downstrokes. This is my more affordable offering for print items and services. My modern calligraphy style is done using a nib and ink (otherwise known as pointed pen), a paint brush, or a brush pen and there are variations in stroke weight, which means letters have thin upstrokes and thick downstrokes. The different tools and materials for modern calligraphy all achieve different effects. \\n\\nFor digital designs and downloads, I use digital pens to create similar effects for each style; there is no difference in cost for digital designs.\\n\\nWHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR BOOKING LARGE ENVELOPE ADDRESSING, PLACE CARDS OR ESCORT CARDS ORDERS?\\nA nonrefundable retainer consisting of 50% of the total balance is due upon booking and contract signature before services commence. Large envelope, place card/escort card orders placed within two weeks or less will incur a rush fee.\\n\\nThe remaining balance, plus taxes and shipping costs if applicable, is due before delivery of the completed services. The balance may be adjusted to reflect any changes to the services, scope of work, and/or modifications of the contract and/or proposal. Any adjustments to the balance will be reflected in the second and final payment. Final payment is due upon receiving the final listing.\\n\\nWHO PROVIDES THE ENVELOPES, PLACE CARDS, AND/OR ESCORT CARDS?\\nIf you provide the materials, you will need to pay the costs associated with shipping them to me. *Note: Some envelopes and cardstock do not work well with calligraphy inks, so if you do not already have them, I recommend asking your stationer if the envelopes or cardstock can handle calligraphy ink. You will need to provide 20% more materials than total guest count. This is an industry standard. When using real ink, ink splatters or smudges are possible. The extra quantity will allow for any ink mistakes or possible last-minute additions. If you&#39;d like me to provide the materials, please indicate color choice and size. I will add 20% more to the order and will add the cost of these materials to your final cost.\\n\\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ESCORT CARDS AND PLACE CARDS?\\nBoth escort cards and place cards inform guests where they will be seated. Escort cards are typically less formal, include guest name and table indicator, and direct guests to a specific table. Place cards are more formal, include guest name, and direct guests to a specific seat at a table. If you would prefer to not use escort cards, you could also consider a seating chart. Also, you don’t have to do place cards unless your venue requires them. Letter B Calligraphy and Design offers all of these items and services.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE:\\nShop policies, prices, and product availability are subject to change at any time.\\n\\nHOW SHOULD I FORMAT MY GUEST ADDRESS LIST FOR ENVELOPE ADDRESSING, OR LARGE PLACECARDS/ESCORT CARDS ORDERS?\\nIf you book Letter B Calligraphy and Design, you will receive a guide on how to submit your guest address list, which includes tips and requirements for submitting a guest list. If you have any questions, please let me know before you submit your list.  \\n\\nFor envelope addressing, I do not accept guest address lists in any other format other than options provided in this guide. *Note: Letter B Calligraphy and Design reserves the right to move information down to next lines due to spacing concerns. You will not be billed for additional lines.\\n\\nWHAT IF I FIND AN ERROR IN MY ENVELOPE/PLACE CARD/ESCORT CARD ORDER OR HAVE ADDITIONAL GUESTS I NEED TO ADD TO MY LIST?\\nPlease review your order within 2 days of receiving it to confirm there are no errors. If there are any errors or additions, please email Letter B Calligraphy and Design a complete list of corrections within 2 days of receiving the order, and specify if any errors were caused by the calligrapher. Any errors caused by calligrapher will be free of charge. If errors were caused by client, one round of edits/additions is included. There is a $25 charge for any additional changes needed.\\n\\nLetter B Calligraphy and Design will bill the client for any late additions or client errors. \\n\\n*Note: Calligraphy/hand-lettering is an art form done by hand, and there may be slight variations in spacing, sizing, margins, color, etc.\\n\\nWHAT LETTERING/CALLIGRAPHY STYLES DO YOU OFFER?\\nI offer many different styles to achieve your overall vision! Reference Letter B Calligraphy and Design’s website gallery or Instagram @letterbcalligraphy for ideas. If you decide you would like to work with me, I can also help you choose the best style to complement your event or project.\\n\\nPlease note: if you send me another artist&#39;s work as inspiration, while I may use it as a reference for your overall vision, I will never copy their work and will always letter/calligraphy in my own style.\\xa0',\n",

Click on the &#39;Read More&#39; button below for all the info! \\n\\nSHIPPING TIMES: I currently ship 3 times a week. Delivery is usually via Royal Mail services as standard, and will take the following times:\\n\\nUK orders: Approx 1-2 working days from posting.\\n(Delivery timescales are approximate, and don&#39;t include weekends, bank holidays, or the first (posting) day.)\\n\\n* * International Orders: I&#39;ve recently restarted shipping internationally again. Hooray! International buyers can once again order as normal. International shipping times will vary depending on destination, and due to the impacts of global events such as Brexit, Covid etc. and at busy times such as Christmas, Valentine&#39;s Day etc. occasionally shipping times can be a little longer than usual. All my items ship from Scotland (UK), so if you are ordering for a specific date or event, please make sure to order in plenty of time! As a guide, international shipping times will be approximately as follows:\\n\\nEurope & EU: Approx 4-6 working days from posting.\\nUSA: Approx 7-10 working days from posting.\\nAll other International Destinations: Approx 7-14 working days from posting.\\n\\n(Actual times may vary depending on the postal system in the destination country. Delivery timescales are approximate, and don&#39;t include weekends, bank holidays, or the first (posting) day.)\\n\\nThanks once again to all my wonderful international customers for your patience whilst I was unable to ship internationally. I look forward to sending you all some lovely goodies in the mail again soon! * *\\n\\nSOCIAL MEDIA: Want to know more about what&#39;s happening behind the scenes?

       "  'policy_welcome': 'WHO IS DESIGNS BY ROBYN LOVE\\n\\nMeet Robyn: the calligrapher and designer. Minister&#39;s wife (www.warriorspathonline.com) and mother of two boys. With a passion for all things vintage trendy and heaven sent. I try to do most of the work I can but this business is growing so I am sharing the work load with these talented people below...\\n\\nMeet Derrick: My amazingly sweet and God focused husband who is the backbone of this business. He answers emails, edits listings, runs the errands, prints, cuts, packages, and re-prints, re-cuts, and re-packages. He truly is my better half, the man who brought me to the Lord and continues to help me back to the cross. \\n\\n\\n.............NOW THE MUST READ...............\\n\\nI am a perfectionist.\\n\\nI will do everything in my power to make the final product meet your desires. And I will do it JOYFULLY. But please understand my style and point of view....\\n\\n.....I make art. No two pieces will look exactly alike when they are being handwritten or painted.\\n\\n.....I hate cookie cutter. If you are looking for the perfection you get with typed pieces, this probably isn&#39;t the best fit. I am self taught and do not thrive on form but design and the overall picture.\\n\\n......I love people. I want to know my customer&#39;s voice and build a relationship over hard decision making and also the everyday grind (yes I too do the mundane things of life). So treat me with the respect that you would want to be treated with and know that I do make mistakes, and there are things (like shipping and the magic place where missing packages go) that are completely out of my control! I am not God and will never attempt to be Him.\\n\\n.....I plan on having you walk away saying that I am one of the most honest people you know. I will not cheat you, I will tell you the truth, and I will apologize for my wrongs. I hope you will see a glimmer of my Savior in my actions. And I hope to learn through every lesson.\\n\\n.....I try to make the process as easy and quick as possible. But I cannot read the policies for you. Please take time to learn about my calligraphy by visiting my website (www.designsbyrobynlove.com), reading through my questionnaire (www.designsbyrobynlove.com under process), and when all else fails asking. But you will make the process better for yourself, my other clients and me and my team by READING!',\n",

       "  'policy_shipping': 'All originals ship with full insurance. So that is why the shipping price is so high. This is essential so that if it is lost or damaged, the full price is refunded by the shipping company.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am NOT responsible for\\r\\n\\r\\n.... late or lost packages. I am very careful about shipping. I know the ropes. But there are those rare cases that the post office really does lose something. \\r\\n\\r\\n.... the wrong shipping address! MAKE SURE BOTH ETSY AND PAYPAL HAVE THE RIGHT ADDRESS PLEASE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day of wedding items must be shipped UPS if they are arriving the week of the wedding. Please let me know if this is the case so I can alter shipping prices. They will be higher than the rates shown, which are for USPS. Sorry.\\r\\n\\r\\n***** IF for any reason the print/product doesn&#39;t come is 100% PERFECT CONDITION please message me. The post office is the culprit. They will pay me to redo the art. DO NOT LEAVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. I cannot control the post office but I do promise that you will get a PERFECT piece in the end. We just *might* have to give it a second chance.  ',\n",

You have come to the right place for your letterpress and calligraphy needs.  I am a rare breed; I use both my right and left side of my brain....

I have a wealth of knowledge when it comes to etiquette concerns (for envelope addressing)and can help you make that balance between tradition and your personal preferences.

We understand this is not the &quot;easiest&quot; way of doing things, but we want to be sure your bespoke letterpress and calligraphy items end up in your hands. :)  When paying please put the correct shipping address in Paypal as we generate our shipping labels there.  Many people opt to have their invites shipped directly to their work address (or sometimes their parents), as there is typically someone there to sign for it.',\n",

No refunds/exchanges are given.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we made a mistake (we triple check our orders before they go out, so this is VERY rare) please just let us know ASAP and we will correct the mistake and ship them back to you (shipping on us of course!). \\r\\n\\r\\nFor all invitations it falls under the client&#39;s responsibility to check all proofs THOUROUGHLY.  We can&#39;t stress this enough.  Check, check, show your fiancé, show your friend, neighbor, whomever.  Once I order the printing plates, no refunds will be given.  If you need to change something after I order printing plates, or after I print the shop, I will have to reorder plates, and reprint the job, which will be at cost to the client. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe require any claims made against damage, miscount, etc to be made within 48 hours of acceptance.

Invite suites and marriage certificates will cost much more than $100. This $100 listing is just to hold a spot on our calendar and to start the design process.  Deposits are non-refundable, so please message us with any questions and to get a quote BEFORE purchasing\\r\\n\\r\\n☞Do you ship to Australia (or Canada, or Japan, or South Africa)? \\r\\n     Yes!!  Anywhere that Fedex or UPS goes, we go.  About 30% of our business is overseas and we LOVE doing business with people of other cultures!  Please note that all price quotes we give are in USD and the client is responsible for any taxes/levies/duties that your country may impose.\\r\\n\\r\\n☞Do you charge sales tax (USA)?  \\r\\n     Yes and no.  We only charge sales tax in our home state of Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\n☞Can you print something I designed?  \\r\\n     Yes!  We welcome your creativity. \\r\\n\\r\\n☞Can I get a discount if I design my own invites? \\r\\n     No.  While, we love that you are being creative, we have found that many times when we print designs our clients have designed that it ends up taking just as much (if not more) labor on our ends.\\r\\n\\r\\n☞Are the colors customizable?  \\r\\n     Yes!  Everything and we mean everything can be changed to suit your needs and     personal style.\\r\\n\\r\\n☞I am a member of the LGBTQ community. Would you be comfortable making our invites (or marriage certificate).  \\r\\n     Of course!!  We would be absolutely honored to create the invites or marriage certificate of your dreams. We welcome it!\\r\\n\\r\\n☞How many rounds of proofs are included?\\r\\n     Infinity. Seriously. Unlimited. Free.  \\r\\n     We will happily do unlimited amounts of digital proofs for your invites.  We will do them M-F.  Please allow 24 hours between rounds of proofs.',\n",

Can I print your chalk design on black paper with white ink?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The fonts aren&#39;t displaying correctly. How do I fix this?\\r\\nThe text will not appear properly until you download and install the fonts. To do this, open the Font List included in your order. Download all fonts in the list, and make sure to install each font on your computer (this step is very important). If you do not know how to install fonts on your computer, follow this link for step-by-step instructions: www.fontspring.com/support/installing\\r\\nAfter you’ve installed each font, relaunch MS Word and open the template. If you&#39;re still not seeing the text as it should appear, please send us a message and we can offer you a different solution.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Can you do custom orders?\\r\\nYes, we do custom orders!  We can adjust any of the designs in our shop with your custom wording, colors, graphics, etc.  Please contact us via Etsy Conversations and let us know what you&#39;d like, and we&#39;ll give you a cost/time estimate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can also create custom designs from scratch, but the price will vary on an individual basis. Please contact us if you&#39;re interested!\\r\\n\\r\\n3. How do I download my files after purchase? Where is my order?\\r\\nMany of our items are digital downloads, which are instantly available in your Etsy account after you’ve completed your purchase. Etsy has easy instructions for how to do this! Here&#39;s where to find them: https://www.etsy.com/help/article/3949\\r\\n\\r\\n4. I sent you a message, when will I receive a response? \\r\\nCustomer service hours are Monday through Friday, between 12-7pm Pacific Standard Time.  All customer messages are answered in the order they are received.  We do our best to reply within 1-2 business days (and often reply same or next day), but please note that this is not guaranteed.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Can I edit your templates on my phone or tablet?\\r\\nOur templates are designed in Microsoft word, and require Microsoft® Word 2003 or higher to edit. We can not offer technical support for use in other programs, or on mobile devices. All templates are .doc file format.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Can I print your chalk design on black paper with white ink?\\r\\nAs far as we know, printers don&#39;t have white ink. When you print, whatever is white is treated as blank and is not printed. With that said, you can definitely print on colored paper, which will show through wherever there is white in the design.  \\r\\n\\r\\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\r\\n\\r\\nTerms and Conditions:\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of our designs are copyright © BirDIY Design and are for your own Personal Use Only.

We do not suggest printing at a photo lab such as Wallgreens or Costco since our files are not photos. We prefer to send PDF files for best print quality, but can send JPG files by request if you need for web, Evite or text use. We do not sell PNG files for most of our listings.\\n\\nHOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RECEIVE MY EDITED FILES?\\nWhat is your turn around time?\\n\\nOnce all of your information has been received, your proof files will be ready within 48 hours.\\n\\nProofs are only kept open for 24 hours. If no change request is received proof is considered APPROVED and order is closed. Lyon&#39;s Prints does not store your files on our computers for longer then 7 days.\\n\\nAll items are in digital format. Files will be sent to your email address linked to your etsy account. Or you may provide another email address. No printed material will be shipped. Please check spam folder if you do not see it after 48 hours.\\n\\n• If you need your files faster, a RUSH order upgrade add on is available:\\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/221176261/add-on-rush-order-printabledigital-file?ref=shop_\\n\\nREVISIONS?\\nAre revisions included?\\n\\nRevisions to text are not included, so please double check the info you provide at time of order or there will be a $5 fee to re-edit to add or change info. Revisions to add or change photos are not included so please be sure the picture you send us at time of order is the photo you want to use. Graphic changes, color changes and size changes are not included. If you select the wrong sample photo or color option, there will be an additional fee to edit since we do need to charge for our time to make the corrections. Custom orders include a few reasonable revisions on a case by case basis. After we have reached our hourly time, an additional revision fee will apply as we do not offer unlimited revisions.\\n\\nWHAT TYPE OF FILES DO YOU SEND?\\nWe will provide you with an edited, 300 dpi high resolution digital PDF file OR JPG file by request (PDF files will have better resolution for printing). We will send you a single file for easy uploading to online printing sites OR can put 2 on a sheet by request only and a $5 set up fee will apply. ( You will not be able to print double sided though)\\n\\n( Please note we do not set up 2 ticket or VIP pass invitations on a sheet because printing them double sided can be difficult, your printer will need to set that up. We will provide you the front & Back files individually to do that.)\\n\\nWE CANNOT RELEASE LAYERED PSD FILES\\n\\nCOPYRIGHT INFORMATION\\nOur company website shown on the designs in our samples will come as shown. It is on there for copyright purposes and will not be removed.\\n\\nLyon&#39;s Prints/Heather Daniels maintains all copyright ownership over the designs, which includes custom designs that were made for you as a work for hire. We hold the right to re-list all of our designs in our shop to re-sell. You are paying for the personal use only rights to print our designs.\\n\\nIf you wish to post our designs online or on social media you must include a link back to our shop. www.Lyonsprints.com\\n\\nPhotos that you provide us may be used as shop sample photos unless you request them not to be.\\n\\nHOW LONG DO YOU KEEP FILES FOR?\\nWe cannot store your files on our hard drives after they have been provided to you as they take up too much storage space with the high volume of orders we do. Please download your files as soon as  we send them to you. Files will be deleted after 5 days.\\n\\nDO YOU OFFER REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES? DO COUPONS APPLY TO ALL ORDERS?\\nDue to the nature of this business, we  do not offer refunds, exchanges or cancellations..  We ask that you please proofread your files before printing and let us know of any issues. We cannot be held responsible for typos if you do not proofread your proofing files before sending them to get printed. We suggest printing a sample before having them all printed.\\n\\nShop Coupons are not valid on custom orders since much more editing time is required and coupons must be used at time of order.\\n\\nCOLOR OUTPUT AND FILE SET UP\\nPlease note that all monitors and printers show/print colors slightly different. The final printed product may vary slightly from what you see on your screen. There is no way for us to guarantee the color from other printers. What you see on screen is in RGB mode, but printers print in CMYK mode so colors will vary.\\n\\nWe cannot change the file size or crop marks for your printer that you choose to work with. All of our customers use different printers and we cannot change the file specs for your individual printer.\\n\\nCustom color orders must provide color swatches at time of order. If you order custom colors and change your mind after you see the swatch that you provided in the design there will be a color change revision fee to change.\\n\\nHOURS OF OPERATION\\nM-F 9 am-5 pm PST\\nCLOSED Weekends and Holidays\\n\\nPlease still feel free to make a purchase or contact us after those hours, just know we may not respond until the following business day',\n",

If you see other designs like mine, please realize that I do not copy or build from other people&#39;s art or designs, and I will not do so purposely for profit. I can make items using phrases that are not copyrighted or trademarked. If you find my digital files for sale or offered in another location, please inform me, as this is not allowed. If you have an idea or phrase you like, I would love to make it happen for you! But please do not send me pictures of items you would like duplicated or &quot;something similar to&quot; - I will not copy someone else&#39;s art, as I have been a victim of this. I have been drawing my whole life, and love letters. My signature &quot;LetterBanners&quot; appear in some of my art, and are an extension of a letter that turns into a banner. :) I love drawing, and can&#39;t wait to create something unique for my customers!\\r\\n\\r\\n***ANY of our original vector art designs can be printed as a simple piece of DIY wall art. Please contact us via conversations if you need a certain file type or size. I am currently working on adding printable 8&quot; x 10&quot; jpg files to most downloads.

That being said, I will do my best to respond to conversations and custom requests within 24 hours, likely sooner. Weekends (Friday night - Sunday night) - especially Sundays - are reserved for family time, however, I do have a hard time sticking to my own rules. ;) If you send me a message after 5pm on a Friday, I may not respond until Monday morning. Thanks for understanding! :)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that everything you&#39;ll find here is unique to my shop. At The Smudge Factory™, you&#39;ll find a few one-of-a-kind hand-painted signs, some chalk art printables, and hand-lettered re-scalable SVG vector cut files. My kids leave their marks all over my home in the form of hand and fingerprint &quot;smudges,&quot; so it seemed only fitting to add my personal &quot;smudge&quot; to every item created here at The Smudge Factory™. This is why everything that&#39;s created is hand-lettered or drawn, solely by me. None of my items are created using fonts; none of my items are made using clip art.\\r\\n\\r\\n***COMMERCIAL LICENSING IS AVAILABLE! Some designs are FREE for commercial use. Some require an additional purchase, which keeps them more exclusive to those who want to sell items using our art! :)  Please read listing descriptions to be sure you understand my licensing requirements. I keep very detailed records of who has purchased commercial licensing and for which designs. Please be aware of this if you plan to sell my items. All files offered on Freebie Friday are for personal use only, however - commercial licensing may be purchased to use with your free design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for visiting!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll designs and layouts are Copyright © 2017 | The Smudge Factory™, LLC | All Rights Reserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE: PLEASE DO NOT copy or plagiarize my items and pass them off as your own; doing so is punishable by law. Almost all of my designs have official copyright numbers, and all my designs come strictly from my noggin&#39; or are suggestions from my customers - not by watching &quot;trends&quot; or copying other Etsy shops. ;) If we come across our designs being sold without a commercial license or being plagiarized, please realize that our first priority is protecting our work. \\r\\n\\r\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\r\\nPLEASE READ our Policies before purchasing digital files from our shop.

You can reference the Etsy Privacy Policy to learn more about its privacy practices. \\n\\n1. Personal Information I Collect:\\nTo fulfil your order, you must provide me with certain information (which you authorised Etsy to provide to me), such as your name, email address, postal address, payment information, and the details of the product that you’re ordering. You may also choose to provide me with additional personal information (for a custom order, for example), if you contact me directly.\\n2. Why I Need Your Information & How I Use It:\\nI rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including:\\n• As needed to provide my services, such as when I use your information to fulfill your order, to settle disputes, or to provide customer support;\\n• When you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for my mailing list;\\n• If necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law; and\\n• As necessary for the purpose of my legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as \\n     A) Providing and improving my services. I use your information to provide the services you requested and in my legitimate interest to improve my services; and \\n     B) Compliance with the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use. I use your information as necessary to comply with my obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.\\n\\n3. Information Sharing and Disclosure:\\nInformation about my customers is important to my business. I share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\\n• Etsy. I share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you my services and comply with my obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.\\n• Service providers. I engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to my shop, such as delivery companies. I will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.\\n• Business transfers. If I sell or merge my business, I may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.\\n• Compliance with laws. I may collect, use, retain, and share your information if I have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: \\n     (A) Respond to legal process or to government requests; \\n     (B) Enforce my agreements, terms and policies; \\n     (C) Prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or \\n     (D) protect the rights, property, and safety of my customers, or others.\\n\\n4. Data Retention:\\nI retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with my services and as described in my Privacy Policy. However, I may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce my agreements. I generally keep your data for the following time period: 4 years.\\n5. Transfers of Personal Information Outside the EU:\\nI may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the Europe, US and other jurisdictions. As a result, I may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If I am deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, I rely on Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer, as Google Cloud is Privacy Shield certified.\\n6. Your Rights:\\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. I describe these rights below:\\n• Access. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information I hold about you by contacting me using the contact information below.\\n• Change, restrict, delete.

If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact me at thesmudgefactory@gmail.com.\\n\\nDO YOU ACCEPT CUSTOM DIGITAL FILE ORDERS?\\nCustom orders for digital files are sometimes accepted, depending on my current workload. Please message me for current turnaround times. I provide proofs, but I require payment before I start sketching. Please know that I work hard to ensure that you&#39;re happy with what you receive from me. :)\\n\\nI am not a copy machine; I will not copy someone else&#39;s work. I can take ideas from something you like and come up with my own design, but I can not - and will not - reproduce someone else&#39;s work for profit. If you find an item somewhere that is similar to something in my shop, please know that outside of using common phrases - many of which are suggested by my customers - all my items are my personal property. Thanks for understanding!\\n\\nDO YOU ACCEPT CUSTOM WOOD SIGN ORDERS?\\nI am not currently accepting custom wood sign orders at this time.\\n\\nWHY IS YOUR SIGN INVENTORY LOW? CAN I STILL BUY THE SIGN I FAVORITED?\\nAfter welcoming our 5th child in the summer of 2016, we have decided to move away from creating wood signs. Thanks for understanding! :)\\n\\nDO YOU OFFER COMMERCIAL LICENSING?\\nCommercial licensing is available! Please see the Commercial Licensing section in my shop for details.\\n\\nIf you purchase a file without commercial licensing, it remains personal use only, unless stated in the listing description. Please see individual listing descriptions for details on our Personal Use Policy.\\n\\nCustom designs do not automatically come with commercial licensing. Commercial licensing is available for purchase on custom designs, however if you want exclusivity to such designs, there is an additional charge and it must be discussed upfront. Please inquire for details.\\n\\nCAN I SELL ITEMS I MAKE USING YOUR ART?\\nYes, however - most designs are personal use only unless commercial licensing is purchased separately. If you would like to sell items using our designs, please purchase commercial licensing for each of the files you wish to use. Each listing description states our Personal Use Policy, so please find the file you would like and carefully read the listing description. There are separate listings outlining our Commercial Use Policy with pricing. The files that are free commercial use are marked accordingly.\\n\\nDO YOU HAVE ANY COUPONS?\\nCurrent coupon codes are always listed in my shop header. Visit my shop homepage to see any current offers.\\n\\nDO YOU OFFER ANY FONTS?\\nI have started to create fonts, but they are unavailable on Etsy.\\n\\nHOW CAN I CONTACT YOU?\\nPlease send us an Etsy Conversation for the quickest response. \\n\\nIf you need to snail-mail something to us, please write:\\n\\nThe Smudge Factory™, LLC\\nP.O. Box 145\\nPalmyra, PA 17078\\n\\nWHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL USE POLICY?\\nOur Personal Use Policy is outlined in every listing, however - the entire policy can be viewed on our Facebook page (Facebook.com/TheSmudgeFactory). Our designs MAY NOT be uploaded to any file sharing page or website for ANY reason. Almost all of our designs are covered by federal copyright numbers. Please contact us if you have any questions. You may only sell items containing our art that are marked as Free Commercial Use, or if you have purchased the appropriate licensing listing to go along with the design. Some designs are not available to be sold with commercial use in any format. Please ask if you have questions about these designs. Thanks for understanding!',\n",

You can reference the Etsy Privacy Policy to learn more about its privacy practices. \\n\\n1. Personal Information I Collect:\\nTo fulfil your order, you must provide me with certain information (which you authorised Etsy to provide to me), such as your name, email address, postal address, payment information, and the details of the product that you’re ordering. You may also choose to provide me with additional personal information (for a custom order, for example), if you contact me directly.\\n2. Why I Need Your Information & How I Use It:\\nI rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including:\\n• As needed to provide my services, such as when I use your information to fulfill your order, to settle disputes, or to provide customer support;\\n• When you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for my mailing list;\\n• If necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law; and\\n• As necessary for the purpose of my legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as \\n     A) Providing and improving my services. I use your information to provide the services you requested and in my legitimate interest to improve my services; and \\n     B) Compliance with the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use. I use your information as necessary to comply with my obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.\\n\\n3. Information Sharing and Disclosure:\\nInformation about my customers is important to my business. I share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\\n• Etsy. I share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you my services and comply with my obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.\\n• Service providers. I engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to my shop, such as delivery companies. I will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.\\n• Business transfers. If I sell or merge my business, I may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.\\n• Compliance with laws. I may collect, use, retain, and share your information if I have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: \\n     (A) Respond to legal process or to government requests; \\n     (B) Enforce my agreements, terms and policies; \\n     (C) Prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or \\n     (D) protect the rights, property, and safety of my customers, or others.\\n\\n4. Data Retention:\\nI retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with my services and as described in my Privacy Policy. However, I may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce my agreements. I generally keep your data for the following time period: 4 years.\\n5. Transfers of Personal Information Outside the EU:\\nI may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the Europe, US and other jurisdictions. As a result, I may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If I am deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, I rely on Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer, as Google Cloud is Privacy Shield certified.\\n6. Your Rights:\\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. I describe these rights below:\\n• Access. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information I hold about you by contacting me using the contact information below.\\n• Change, restrict, delete. You may also have rights to change, restrict my use of, or delete your personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where I am required to store data for legal reasons) I will generally delete your personal information upon request.\\n• Object. You can object to (i) my processing of some of your information based on my legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from me after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, I will delete your personal information unless I have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.\\n• Complain. If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about my use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.\\nHow to Contact Me:\\nFor purposes of EU data protection law, I, Rachel Fritz, am the data controller of your personal information.

Please send me a photo of (or link to) your preferred paper, and the dimensions, and I&#39;ll give you a quote.\\n\\nOTHER PAPER HAND LETTERING, LIKE INVITATIONS\\nI&#39;d love to help. Seating charts, envelope addressing, favors, bags, stickers, you name it. Drop me a line with what you have in mind.\\n\\nTIME NEEDED TO CREATE AND SHIP PLACE CARDS\\nI need about 4-5 days for every 100 cards. Rush orders are possible for a 50% rush fee. If I don&#39;t have enough of your paper color on hand, we will need to build in additional time to order more.\\n\\nShipping via Priority Mail usually takes ~3 days, but I prefer a buffer of 6-10 days. Please allow for additional time if shipping internationally - minimum of 10 days for Priority Mail.\\n\\nPLACE CARDS: HOW TO ORDER\\nPlease start a conversation with me, or request a custom order, and let me know the following information:\\n\\n- how many place cards you need\\n- paper color\\n- ink color\\n- any customizations (e.g., table numbers and/or meal choice)\\n- what date you need the cards in hand\\n- the date of your event\\n- whether you are outside of the US\\n\\nWith that information, I&#39;ll be able to create a private custom order for you to review. Purchasing the order guarantees your spot in my schedule.\\n\\nGLASS + BRASS SIGNS: SIZES\\nI usually have 5x7&quot; and 8x10&quot; frames in stock, along with 5x7&quot; hinged frames. \\n\\nAdditionally, I also seek out harder-to-find small brass frames and larger frames (which can be shipped via Priority Mail Boardgame Boxes).\\n\\nGLASS + BRASS SIGNS: HOW TO ORDER\\nRequest a custom order, or start a conversation with me, and let me know what size sign you&#39;d like, and what you&#39;d like it to say. Please also let me know what kind of hook you&#39;d like - a chain or sawtooth hook. You can see your options here: http://bit.ly/landkchains\\n\\nGLASS + BRASS SIGNS: REPLICATION + PROMOTION OF CUSTOM SIGNS\\nIf you request a unique or original combination of words and/or dates for your sign, I won&#39;t replicate it for another customer or list it for sale in my Etsy shop. \\n\\nI do share photos of finished items on Etsy and Instagram, so please let me know if you prefer for your sign to stay private. \\n\\nI reserve the right to reproduce any signs that include common phrases or quotes, even if you are the first person to commission that piece (e.g., &quot;love,&quot; &quot;forever & ever amen,&quot; &quot;please sign our guestbook,&quot; &quot;coffee is for closers,&quot; and so on).\\n\\nREFUND POLICY FOR DELAYED OR DAMAGED ITEMS\\nIf your item is...\\n\\ndelayed due to an error on my end: I will refund you in full. \\n\\nlost by a postal carrier: I will file a claim for the missing item (and you will also need to plan to due so). I will refund you after the is reimbursed by the carrier OR the item is returned to me (First Class Mail is not insured, so refund only if item is returned).\\n\\ndamaged during shipping: send me pictures. I will file a claim (you might also need to do so). Place Cards are shipped in waterproof packaging. Glass + Brass signs are fragile and if they break I will recreate the sign and ship it free of charge.\\n\\nsuccessfully delivered (per package tracking) but missing: we can both file claims; no refund.\\n\\nHOW TO PREVENT DELAYED OR MISSING DELIVERIES\\nBuild more time into your timeline for shipping. Priority Mail claims to be ~3 days, but allow for 10. Express Mail claims to be overnight, but allow for 4 days. \\n\\nThis can be difficult with event place cards but not a deal breaker. You can send me your list of names in two waves, for example, or pay a rush fee for me to create them as quickly as humanly possible. \\n\\nOr you can opt for more reliable shipping methods, such as Signature Confirmation or shipping via UPS instead of USPS. Let&#39;s figure out the scenario that helps us both rest easy!',\n",

If tracking is provided through Etsy for your purchase on these items, please note that it is only tracking a *general* location of where your item is, and therefore is not as specific as other shipping methods. Etsy tracking on these items does not provide an actual trackable code, and the general location of your item can only be followed via Etsy (not USPS). Your order may show as delivered a few days before you actually get your item; if you do not receive your order in-person within five days after it has been marked as delivered, please contact me for assistance. \\n\\n• All hand-typed prints with a frame will be shipped via USPS First Class Package Service (1-3 business days) and will provide accurate tracking for your specific order. \\n\\n• All calligraphed envelopes will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail (1-3 business days) and will also provide accurate tracking for your specific order. \\n\\nDue to delays the post office has been experiencing over the past two years, I am unable to guarantee exact shipping estimates, but please know that I am doing all I can to get your order to you in a timely manner. Once your order has left my possession, it is simply out of my control and in the hands of the post office, which is unfortunately, almost entirely unpredictable at this time. Please expect to allow an additional buffer of at least a few days to allow for these possible delays. If you do not receive your order within 10 days of your order being initially marked as shipped, please reach out and I can look into it and we can come up with a solution together. \\n\\nThank you so much for your understanding and continued support!',\n",

For delivery to the UK or Europe please message me with your location, event date and what you&#39;d like to order and I will let you know if it is possible.\\n\\nI need at least 3-4 WORKING DAYS for UK orders, please message first.\\n\\nI LIKE ONE OF YOUR LISTINGS BUT WITH A DIFFERENT COLOUR, SIZE OR FINISH, IS THIS POSSIBLE?\\nI can customize any listing in my shop, as well as design from scratch to suit your event.

       "  'policy_additional': '✅ ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS ➜\\nWe usually ask you to provide your info in the &quot;Personalization&quot; or &quot;Notes&quot; box when placing you order. For PORTRAITS, each design has a unique web link for sending over your photos. \\n\\nPlease scroll through each item&#39;s photos and read its DESCRIPTION section for complete ordering info and FAQs.\\n\\n✅ CURRENT TIMING ➜\\nYou can expect emailed proofs (or printable files) within 4–7 business days of your order date for non-portrait orders. Portrait proofs take 2–3 weeks. For PRINTED items, you&#39;ll be asked to approve the design for print (or revise, if needed). \\n\\nPrinting and shipping takes approximately 2–3 weeks from proof approval. For PRINTABLE orders, you will be able to download and print as soon as you&#39;re happy with the emailed design. \\n\\nAllow an additional 1–2 business days per revision (2–3 business days for portrait revisions).\\n\\nYou can normally expect things on the quicker end of the ranges given, but we are not able to provide delivery guarantees on non-rush orders.\\n\\n✅ 🔥 RUSHING YOUR ORDER ➜\\nWe offer a variety of rush options under &quot;Shipping&quot; at Checkout. Or, you can add rush to an existing order here: \\n\\nPORTRAIT: https://www.etsy.com/listing/605464486/rush-my-portrait\\nNON-PORTRAIT: https://www.etsy.com/listing/235001511/rush-my-design\\n\\nYou may also choose to rush the printing & shipping portion of the process only. A link to shipping upgrade options will be included in the email you receive with your proof.\\n\\n✅ CHOOSING PHOTOS FOR PORTRAITS ➜\\nThere&#39;s no need for everyone to be together in the photo. Separate photos for each person are just fine. A high-quality, forward-facing photo of each person&#39;s face is what&#39;s most important for a great likeness. Learn more here: https://tinyurl.com/HowToPickPhotos\\n\\n✅ DIY PRINTABLES VIA EMAIL ➜\\nMost items in our shop have the option to choose a &quot;printable&quot;, or &quot;email file only&quot;, if you prefer to print locally. While we highly recommend the professional printing services offered via the shop, choosing this option means you&#39;ll receive personalized, high-resolution, printer-ready (printable) files via email. Please see &quot;CURRENT TIMING&quot; above for how soon to expect the emailed designs.\\n\\n✅ INTERNATIONAL ORDERS ➜\\nUse coupon code PRINTABLEONLY to remove shipping costs from printable orders at checkout. Choosing the printable, and printing locally, is often the quickest, and most affordable option for International customers. International shipping is 2–5 weeks, depending on customs.\\n\\n✅ SIZING (FOR GUEST BOOKS + SEATING CHARTS) ➜\\nHere are suggested sizes:\\n\\n➤ 11” x 14” → for up to 50 guests\\n➤ 16” x 20” → for between 50 and 100 guests\\n➤ 18” x 24” → for between 100 and 150 guests\\n➤ 24&quot; x 36&quot; → for between 150 and 250 guests\\n\\nThe size is really a matter of personal preference, and depends on a few things. For guestbooks, consider whether you expect guests to include a message, as opposed to just a signature etc. For seating charts, consider how far guests will be standing to read them. \\n\\nWhen in doubt, we always suggest going LARGER, rather than smaller.\\n\\n✅ CANCELLATIONS ➜\\nAfter the 4 hour cancellations window has closed, cancellation & refund requests may be accepted on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the complexity of the design, a non-refundable $15–$300 design fee is applicable once the design proof has been started. No orders can be cancelled once approval to print has been given. No exceptions.',\n",

I specialize in custom portrait stamps, perfect for teachers, crafters, and couples. My couples stamps are perfect for stamping on wedding invitations, favours, thank you notes, christmas cards - the opportunities are endless.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt typically takes me 1-2 business days to create a standard stamp. Portrait stamps can take 3-5 business days due to their intricacy. If you require a stamp for a special deadline please notify me upon check-out and I will be in contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuality testing:\\r\\nEach stamp is unique and will be quality tested to ensure that all lines are correct and all negative space is completely removed.\\r\\nAfter the test is complete I will wash it with a gentle soap to remove any excess ink. Due to the nature of ink, it may leave a slight tint to the stamp, but it will not affect your use of the stamp with other inks.\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

If you&#39;re sticking with the same ink colour, or similar colours, it&#39;s fine to keep the ink on the stamp after use. If you&#39;re switching ink colours (ie black to yellow), the best option is to gently wipe your stamp clean with a cleaning wet wipe (ie Clorox wipe). If you don&#39;t have one of these handy you can wash it under warm water with a gentle liquid soap. And for tough stains use a VERY soft tooth brush - but make this a last resort as the bristles can damage the soft rubber.\\n\\nCHRISTMAS POLICY\\nOrders placed after December 14 are not guaranteed to arrive within North America before Christmas.',\n",

I make cute, pretty, everyday greetings that you can relate to. My designs are influenced by my travels, nature, my half-Japanese heritage and the amazing people I know. I love seeking inspiration in the world around me and my art has become a visual diary for me. Here&#39;s to a stress-free life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI try to be as eco-friendly as possible. Most cards are printed on 100% recycled FSC paper, envelopes are 100% kraft recycled paper and the plastic sleeve packaging is biodegradable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy greeting cards, art prints, notepads and other paper goods are now available for wholesale. Please contact me at info [ at ] cynla.com. \\r\\n\\r\\nI make an effort to use images that are as close to the print version as possible - however, colors might not appear exactly as they do on your monitor. Please allow for slight differences. Since papers are recycled, you may see some fibers in the paper. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for the great support of my greeting cards and art.

We are not bound by the Privacy Policies of any third party website that you access by a hyperlink, nor are they bound by ours.  We encourage you to read the Policies of those third party websites  before interacting with them or making purchases. They may collect different information and by different methods than we do. \\n\\n\\nOther purposes: We may disclose your personal data as necessary to comply with any legal obligation or to protect your interests, or the vital interests of others or our company.\\n\\nTRACKING TECHNOLOGIES\\n\\nCookies, Log Files and Web Beacons: Like many other Web sites, we make use of log files. These files merely log visitors to the site – usually a standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services’ analytics. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.\\n\\nWe also use cookies - small text files sent to us by your computer - and web beacons to store certain  information. We may use cookies to authenticate your identity, to determine if you are logged onto our website, for personalization, for security, for targeted advertising, or for analysis of the performance of our website and services.  For example, cookies allow us to recommend blog posts to you based on what you have read on our site in the past.

In addition, when you first encounter our website, you will be asked to “consent to cookies.” If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your individual browser options.  However, this may affect your ability to use or make purchases from our website.

More detail on third party processing is detailed below.\\n\\nHowever, we may, from time to time, process your data internally. The legal basis for this processing is both your consent to the processing, and our need to conduct our legitimate business interests.

We cannot guarantee complete security of any information you transmit to us.\\n\\nBy consent to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that your personal data may be available, via the internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use or misuse of your data by other parties.\\n\\nWe will notify you of promptly any known breach of our security systems or your data which might expose you to serious risk.\\n\\nCHILDREN\\n\\nThis website or mobile app is not designed for use by children under age 16, and we do not knowingly solicit personal data from anyone under age 16.

We ask that you visit the listing description for an estimated ship and arrival date for the item you are interested in.\\n\\nHOW LONG DOES SHIPPING TAKE?\\nI ship USPS priority mail for large products and USPS First Class to the United States, this method takes between 1-3 business days for priority and 2-5 days for first class. Most items marked FREE SHIPPING will ship first class. And keep in mind shipping times are different than processing times which can be between 1-3 weeks depending on the item.\\n\\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\\nPersonal gift messages can be added to your order! Please just let me know that this item is a gift in the &#39;note to seller&#39; section during checkout. I can also write &quot;happy birthday&quot; or &quot;congratulations&quot; on the outside package if being shipped directly to gift recipient.\\n\\nSIZING DETAILS\\nAll dimensions are detailed in each item description but can vary by ¼ inch.\\n\\nCUSTOM AND PERSONALIZED ORDERS\\nI gladly accept custom and personalized requests on most of my items. Please reach out to me before your place an order for a custom request not available already in my shop. I am completely open to making something different and new. Personalized signs are final sale and cannot be refunded, returned, or exchanged.\\n\\nDO YOU ACCEPT RETURNS?\\nI do not accept returns because each item is made to order but I am always available to take questions are concerns prior to you placing an order. You may cancel your order within 24 hours of placing your order. I also may be able to help if you there was a quality issue with your order with a shop credit or possible refund, just please message me right away and I will be happy to help as best I can.\\n\\nLOST/MISSING PACKAGES THAT ARE SHOWING DELIVERED\\nUnfortunately I am not responsible for orders once they have shipped. If your tracking status says &#39;delivered&#39; but you never received it, contact your local postal carrier. USPS should be able to provide you with the last known location of your package. It is a common mistake for items to state they are delivered but the postal worker is currently in your area and might have not delivered your items just yet. If you believe your package was stolen, you need to file a report with your local police. I apologize, but no replacement orders will be sent in these situations.\\n\\nORDERS DAMAGED IN TRANSIT\\nI do everything in my power to ensure a safe delivery but this does happen once in a while, usually due to the aggressive postal worker care for these packages. Send me photos immediately of your damaged product AND packaging. I likely will give you the option of a refund or shipping out a new item to you. You must contact me within 3 days of delivery if your package is damaged.',\n",

International orders ship via USPS Priority Mail International (6-10 days), USPS Priority Mail Express (3-5 days), or USPS First Class Parcel (shipping time varies by country).\\r\\n\\r\\nDomestic DIY paperie materials (envelopes, sashes, and enclosures) ship by the seller&#39;s choice of USPS Priority Mail or UPS Ground Saver for an average shipping time of 2-6 days unless upgraded to a specified faster method, while international orders of DIY paperie materials ship by USPS First Class International Mail (1-4 weeks average) unless upgraded to a faster method/carrier.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrder processing time varies by item, so check the specific listing to find out how long you can expect to wait for your purchases. Complex orders, such as those with invitations AND paperie for the actual event, may be mailed in separate shipments to ensure that you receive time-sensitive materials in time to distribute them on schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeed your order sooner?

If available, additional fees may apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nINTERNATIONAL CUSTOMS CHARGES\\r\\nSome international destinations charge additional fees on merchandise arriving from other countries, including but not limited to: import taxes, additional taxes such as VAT, and customs charges. Any additional fees are typically collected at the time of delivery before your package is released. As a small business, we have no system to predict these fees, which vary by country, nor do we carry the international taxation licenses necessary to collect such fees at the time of purchase; any outstanding customs fees and/or taxes are the buyer&#39;s responsibility to tender upon delivery. If you are unsure of whether any such charges apply, we recommend you contact your postal service for more information about any applicable fees.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOLIDAY SHIPPING TIMES\\r\\nDuring the holidays delivery times on non-guaranteed shipping services may see delays due to high postal volume; we recommend placing an order 3-5 days earlier than usual as a precaution. Allyson DuPont Designs is not responsible for said delays and will not issue refunds for delayed shipping. For international orders, we cannot guarantee delivery times during the holidays, but deliveries can take up to an additional 7-14 days to arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\nRETURNED ITEMS (UNDELIVERABLE/UNCLAIMED PACKAGES)\\r\\nThe buyer is responsible for providing an accurate mailable address and, for international orders, is responsible for tendering any customs fees and taxes upon delivery.

Special orders, including customized or personalized items and wholesale/bulk purchases, can be cancelled for a full refund within 24 hours (includes non-business days) of purchase. After 24 hours any materials costs or labor charges incurred prior to cancellation will deducted from the total refund. If the cancelled order included custom design(s), design fees are not eligible for refund after proof(s) have been delivered electronically to the customer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIY Materials - Orders of non-custom DIY materials may be cancelled within 1 business day of purchase if the item has not shipped. Please be aware that these items often ship same day and cannot be cancelled once in the possession of the shipping agent. Confirmation for items shipping by our base flat rate method and any other UPS service are delayed to the end of the business day in which they shipped; regardless of whether confirmation has yet been set, an order cannot be cancelled if no longer in our possession. In this case, the buyer can return the DIY items at their own expense for a full refund less original shipping charges and a 15% restocking fee. Items must be received in the condition in which they were sent, or only a partial refund may be issued.\\r\\n\\r\\nRUSH ORDERS\\r\\nTo ensure that all Allyson DuPont Designs orders are completed smoothly, we ask that, in the event that a customer would like an item delivered sooner that the processing time indicated, he or she send us a Convo requesting a rush order PRIOR TO PLACING AN ORDER. We will evaluate the time necessary to acquire any special materials and produce the order, and then notify the customer if we can accept the order and what, if any, rush fees or shipping upgrades will apply. If the customer accepts the terms of the rush order, the adjusted timing and price will be included in his or her custom listing. Electronic design proofs will be provided to the customer after ordering (exact timing to be determined on a case-by-case basis), but physical proofs will not be able to be provided for most rush orders.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the customer did not make arrangements for a rush order PRIOR TO PLACING his or her order, we ask that he or she sends us a Convo immediately so we can evaluate our ability to accommodate the rush request. The customer will be notified if his or her order can be fulfilled, and informed of any rush or shipping upgrade fees that apply. If order in question was to be paid in installments, the customer will also be required to pay in full, as we cannot accept installment payments on rush orders. If the customer agrees to the terms of the rush order, any additional fees discussed will be invoiced to the customer and must be paid up front.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the client does not accept the terms of the rush order or we find that we are unable to accommodate his or her timing needs, the order will be canceled within 24 hours. Per our cancellation policy, the cost of any non-returnable special materials (most commonly, but not limited to -- decorative and specialty papers, colored envelopes, etc.) purchased for the order prior to receiving a rush request will be deducted from the final refund given. In cases where a rush request was made in the notes section of the order, a full refund will be given if the order cannot be fulfilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to their rigid timing constraints, we will be unable to accommodate most changes to the format (size, color, embellishments, materials, etc.) of rush orders once placed. Should the client insist upon changes that we are able to accommodate, the client may be liable for additional charges including but not limited to: re-ordering of materials, repeating labor, expedited shipping, additional expedited processing, etc. The client may also be notified of and required to confirm acceptance of delayed delivery of their order as necessary to accommodate any processing delays caused by the requested modifications. Should the client refuse any of these conditions and/or insist upon a change we are unable to accommodate, the client will be considered in breach of the original sales agreement, at which time Allyson DuPont Designs reserves the right to cancel the order. If an order is canceled due to a client&#39;s breach of contract, the following costs will be deducted from their refund due: the cost of specialty, custom, and other non-returnable materials as well as materials already consumed in production prior to cancellation; all applicable labor charges for production completed prior to cancellation; all design fees for which proofs are in process or have already been delivered electronically to the client prior to cancellation; any miscellaneous fees or costs incurred during design/production prior to cancellation. \\r\\n\\r\\nDECORATIVE PAPERS\\r\\nMany of our book covers are made from handmade and/or unique decorative papers. Subtle variations in print, texture, and color may occur from sheet to sheet. We are not responsible for these variations, and they do not constitute a defect.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLOR ACCURACY\\r\\nDue to display irregularities on different devices and monitors, we are unable to guarantee the color accuracy of our digital product photos and swatches. If a precise color match is required, we recommend that customers purchase a physical color swatch or sample DIY product; differences between the color of our products and their appearance on a device are not considered a defect except in cases of a confirmed order fulfillment error.\\r\\n\\r\\nSPELLING & TEXT ACCURACY\\r\\nThe customer is responsible for providing correct spelling and/or accurate text for all personalization and/or custom content, including but not limited to personalized gymnastics score books, nameplates for guest books, planners, etc., and custom invitations, stationery, and paperie. It is the customer&#39;s responsibility to bring to our attention any errors in the text that was provided immediately upon discovery, and provide correction(s) as soon as possible; if production has begun on the order before we are notified of errors, the customer may be responsible for paying duplicate production fees to correct the error. Any errors not reported until immediately before or following delivery can only be corrected at the customer&#39;s expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note: The text provided in the notes section of an order will be used by default for order production, except in cases where a specific request is made to use alternate text.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the event that correct text is provided with the order and the mistake is made on our part, we will provide either a replacement or partial compensation for the mistake, depending on the customer&#39;s preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINTABLES\\r\\nPrintable Invitations include a single-line Allyson DuPont Designs credit on the back. An additional $5 fee will be charged to remove the watermark from these items.\\r\\n\\r\\nCUSTOM CONTENT DELIVERY\\r\\nContent (text, photos, etc) to be provided by the customer must be delivered in a timely manner to ensure production of the order on time. The customer will receive content deadline notifications if the content is not provided at the time of order and unmet deadlines may result in cancellation of the order. In the event of an order cancelation, the customer will receive a refund in accordance with the Allyson DuPont Designs cancellation policy; the purchase price and shipping will be refunded, minus any material, labor, and design charges incurred in the partial production of the order.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIGITAL DOWNLOADS\\r\\nLIMITED LICENSE & TERMS OF USE\\r\\n\\r\\nALLYSON DUPONT DESIGNS reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time without giving you prior notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy purchasing ALLYSON DUPONT DESIGNS digital artwork, you are granted non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, one-person license to use ALLYSON DUPONT DESIGNS digital artwork.

We create all graphics in-house, and we just LOVE design!  We can&#39;t wait to turn your ideas into beautiful labels and ribbon!  Also in 2022, we will be adding to our printing equipment and offering larger format graphics and foil printing on more items! Check back with us often as we add more designs to the shop.  And keep in mind we can create anything for you; a custom graphic makes it special!\\n\\nWE ARE SO HAPPY YOU FOUND US!  You will LOVE the quality of our print products; we do not use rubber stamps for printing, but instead use high quality graphics to create metal printing plates and use solid ink and professional equipment for stunning print results.  You will be so happy with the difference in quality. \\n\\nWe make each custom graphic just for you!  We are also open to custom design projects - just ask!  \\n\\nWe ship orders as quickly as possible, but please note the production options available to you.  Standard production for most items is 5-8 business days.  If you require faster production time (1-2 days or 3-4 days production), please add the item to your cart and select the RUSH production option that reflects your needed time frame.  If you require overnight shipping in addition, please contact us in advance for a custom listing and shipping quote.  We look forward to helping to make your event memorable!\\n\\nWe appreciate your order!  We do not accept cancelations; in some circumstances we will consider shop credit towards a future order.   You will receive a proof in advance of print; you will normally have 24 hours to approve or change the design. Please monitor your Etsy conversations for communications, including print proofs. If we are editing an existing design, your design will approve as per your checkout notes within 24 hours of the proof being sent to you. If you would like any changes to the design once you receive the proof, please get back to us quickly so that the changes may be made.  We want you to receive your items in time and meet the production standard as assigned by the Etsy system.  Thank you for helping us meet this standard.  \\n\\nWe do not insure packages for loss unless requested.  We will provide proof of shipment, but if insurance is needed, please indicate this in advance of order and shipment. Shipping times are less predictable; we will ship your order and the agreed date, but cannot guarantee delivery dates.  Please keep this in mind when ordering and when choosing a shipping preference.  USPS is our standard carrier, but we can also quote UPS expedited services.  In some cases USPS Priority is faster and less expensive than UPS Ground, making it a good choice overall and in normal circumstances.  However UPS expedited has tracking and can result in fewer days shipment times if the time frame is critical.    Thank you!\\n\\nWe are the gals from InTheClear, TIEtheKNOT and InkScissorsPaper!  The time is here!  We hesitate to start fresh with over 30,000 positive feedbacks and almost 100,000 sales in InTheClear, but we are taking the leap!  InTheClear will continue to offer craft supplies and packaging, however our custom work will now move to Paisley Grey Design.

       "  'policy_additional': 'DO YOU ACCEPT RETURNS FOR CUSTOMIZED ITEMS?\\nDue to the nature of the product and the fact that it is a fully customized product that cannot typically be used by another person, refunds are not given. You will receive a proof in advance of print; you will have an opportunity to approve or change the design. Please monitor your Etsy conversations for communications, including print proofs.\\n\\nWe will communicate with you regarding the design used for production. We will then make a printing plate with the same design. If we have made an error in production, we will correct the order at our expense or offer a refund in full. If the customer has approved the proof with an error, we do not offer reprints at our expense.  We will reprint as a new order using the graphic as approved.\\n\\nWHAT ARE THE ITEM SIZES?\\nWe try our best to add descriptive information to our listings.  If you should have any questions regarding the size of an item or its use in a give situation, please inquire in advance of ordering.\\n\\nWe design packaging for small businesses and events and we are happy to help you order the product that you need.\\n\\nUPS ONE CHOICE IMPORTANT INFORMATION\\nThe consignee/ receiver releases all liability from UPS for the delivery of packages through their My Choice account. This includes lost, stolen, or damaged. By selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, it authorizes UPS to release the package to the address when no one is present. UPS will only make one delivery attempt. A UPS delivery record constitutes conclusive proof of delivery and, by selecting the Authorized Shipment Release service, the reciever is asked and is required to accept responsibility for any loss or damage to the package after it has been released.&quot;  Please notify at the time of checkout for an alternate shipping method in the checkout notes.  This  will become part of the sale record & available to us.\\n\\nDO YOU OFFER WHOLESALE PRICING?\\nOur items are offered in bulk with per-order discounts; please inquire and provide the details regarding your business and volume.  We also extend discounts to the trade: wedding planners, designers and stylists can receive pricing discounts as order volume increases over time.\\n\\nFREE SHIPPING, SHIPPING RATES AND DO YOU SHIP INTERNATIONALLY?\\nWe do not charge additional shipping costs for most items; check each listing.  Free shipping includes contiguous United States.  Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories will incur a surcharge; our shipping costs are much higher. \\n\\nWe ship via USPS, UPS or FedEx Ground Services.  If you require expedited delivery, please ask us in advance for a quote.\\n\\nWe are happy to ship internationally.  Due to changes in shipping rates and delivery issues over the years, we do not add this service to our shop listings.  If you are interested in our products and you are located outside of the United States, please email us in advance of your order and inquire about a shipping quote.  We require international orders be insured for full value against loss.\\n\\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CREATE MY ORDER?\\nWe ship orders as quickly as possible, but please note the production options available to you. \\n\\nStandard production for most items is 5-8 business days. If you order prior to 12:00pm central time on any given day, that day will count as the first business day.  \\n\\nIf you require faster production time, please add the item to your cart and select a RUSH production option depending on the speed required.  We also offer 1-3 business days production as well as 3-5 business days production for an additional charge. RUSH production also includes either UPS Ground or UPS 3 Day.\\n\\nIf you require overnight shipping in addition to RUSH production, please contact us in advance for a custom listing and shipping quote.\\n\\nARE MY ITEMS INSURED?\\n*Please see &quot;UPS My Choice&quot; for additional information. \\n\\nOur shipping prices include shipment via USPS without insurance.  We do not insure packages for loss or damage unless requested.  We will provide proof of shipment, but if insurance is needed, please indicate this in advance of order and shipment so that we can add the cost of the insurance to the order.  You have the option to choose UPS expedited or ground; just let us know and we will obtain a shipping quote for you.  We have shipped thousands of packages and very rarely do we experience loss or damage, but we leave it to the customer to decide whether insurance is important.  Thank you!\\n\\nWHAT IF MY ORDER DOES NOT ARRIVE IN TIME?\\nWe ship via USPS Priority Mail most often. Shipping transit times are estimated and there is no guarantee of delivery date with this type of service. If your project is date critical, please contact us in advance for RUSH production (if our schedule allows) and a separate shipping quote using an alternate, tracked service.  *** Shipping times are unpredictable and we leave it to the customer to decide whether expedited shipping or a specialty shipping method is required.  If we agree to ship your product on a given date, we will do so, however we are not responsible for any delays in shipping caused by the carrier or unknown reasons. We cannot guarantee shipping times once the package leaves our office.\\n\\nCUSTOM AND PERSONALIZED ORDERS\\nWe will give you an opportunity to choose the shipping method and provide a quote and shipping time estimate provided by the carrier.  We agree to ship the package during shipping circulation hours soon the given shipping date or prior.  Once the package leaves our office, we are not responsible for delays caused by the shipping carrier. \\n\\nIf your item does not arrive in time, we are sorry that we cannot refund in this circumstance.  If we have caused a delay or made a mistake that has caused the delay and missed delivery, we may offer a store credit for the purchase amount (not inclusive of shipping charge).  \\n\\nPlease plan accordingly with shipping in mind.  We love to help; please inquire in advance. We try to expedite if we can. :)\\n\\nCAN I PAY FOR RUSH PRODUCTION AND SHIPPING?\\nYes!  We have two types of RUSH production and shipping.  Our production times are expressed in business days and do not include Saturday, Sunday or Federal Holidays.  These options are available at checkout.  Keep in mind that we can also produce same-day orders with printing plates made by noon central time and we ship can overnight, but we quote overnight deliveries based on actual purchase - box dimensions & weight.  If you require same-day processing, please email us and we will obtain a shipping quote!\\n\\nYou will receive a proof; we make printing plates quickly for rush orders. Be sure your personalization is accurately in the notes.  Often times we have less than 30 minutes to process items to make the printing & shipping cut-offs.',\n",

       "  'policy_payment': 'SAMPLES\\nSamples of wedding stationery may be ordered before committing to an entire purchase, for some stationery designs. To purchase a sample, send me a request, or purchase the sample listings when available. \\n\\nESTIMATES\\nEstimates are created on a per-project basis. Estimates are considered planning documents, not obligations, and are valid for orders placed within 30 days. Upon placement of order, quantities and prices indicated on the final estimate shall be considered an agreement to purchase.\\n\\nCUSTOM WEDDING ORDERS & DEPOSITS\\nFor wedding orders, a non-refundable down payment of 50% of the total order cost must be paid upon placing an order, which secures your place in line for printing. If you cancel your order at any time, the 50% deposit will be forfeited by the client. It is strongly recommended that clients purchase a hard copy of their invitation suite before sending the entire order to print, to check for accurate spelling and colors in-person. \\n\\nCustom wedding suite designs start at $100 per A7 design, and $60 per A2 or A1 design, which both include 2 complimentary rounds of proofs. After, a $15 alteration fee applies for every round of additional proofs for font, wording etc. (Which is not an entire repainting of the design). \\n\\nCUSTOM STATIONERY\\nA non-refundable down payment of 50% of the total order cost must be paid upon placing an order. Simply email me with your request, and I will calculate the final price and create a custom deposit listing for you, which must be paid before the designing process can continue. You will be provided with up to 2 rounds of proofs in which to finalize the design of your customized stationery after your deposit has been placed (3+ rounds of proofs will incur additional charges of $15.00 each). The remaining balance will be due once the design has been finalized and before the order can be shipped. In paying this remaining balance, you agree that the order has been finalized and can be sent to print. At this point, refunds of the second 50% deposit will not be given, and your agreement to this is by your final payment. \\n\\nCANCELLATION BY US FOR ANY REASON\\nLittle Ivy Paper Goods cannot be responsible for unforeseen circumstances, work-stoppages, &#39;acts-of-God&#39;, which may make it impossible for us to complete your job in a reasonable amount of time. Our complete obligation to you may be discharged in its entirety by our refund of your deposit, without prejudice, and disclaiming any secondary consequences or costs that you may incur.\\n\\nPlease be aware that any delays caused by you will postpone your estimated completion date that we have provided you.\\n\\nCANCELLATION BY THE CUSTOMER FOR ANY REASON\\n￼If you decide to cancel the job prior to any part of it going to print, you agree to forfeit your deposit. Cancellations after the final payment has been completed and the job has gone to print will not be refunded in any way. All quantities of each item provided in a final estimate are covered by this clause upon acceptance of the shop policies. Any quantities lowered or items cancelled are at the sole discretion of Little Ivy Paper Goods and will constitute forfeiture of that portion of the deposit.\\n\\nTURNAROUND TIME\\nTurnaround time is dependent on your swiftness in finalizing the text and font on the stationery. Once an order has been finalized and sent to print, it will take 7-10 business days for printing and a week or so for standard shipping. Rush printing options are available for an additional charge. \\n\\nSHIPPING\\nStandard shipping is about 5-7 business days, barring any unusual circumstances. Upgraded shipping is available for an additional cost. \\n\\nPAYMENT\\nLIPG happily accepts payment through PayPal and credit/debit. Please keep in mind that if you intend to work with me on a custom suite for over a month, the general price of stationery is subject to change from time of inquiry to time of purchase due to fluctuations in the economy.',\n",

Rush shipping is available upon request and additional fees will apply. \\r\\n\\r\\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: I am more than happy to ship internationally. International shipping generally ranges between $100- $200 for full orders. Please contact me for more information. In certain cases, digital, print-ready files may be purchased. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf any order arrives damaged in any way, please refuse the order and have it sent back. It will be re-printed at no extra cost to you, although expedited printing and shipping costs will be at the customer&#39;s expense. ',\n",
       "  'policy_refunds': 'Due to the customization of wedding invitations and related stationery items, refunds and exchanges are not offered. \\n\\nCompleting a final 50% deposit is the client&#39;s approval of the final proof(s). Please look over proofs carefully to avoid misspellings, punctuation and grammatical errors. Clients bear responsibility for accurate proofing prior to sending projects to press. It is our suggestion that the client purchase hard samples to approve before the entire order goes to print, to make sure everything is accurate. \\n\\nDue to the custom nature of our products, once designs have been finalized and given the OK for print, revisions may not be made, and refunds will not be given.',\n",

Why we need your information and how we use it\\n\\nWe rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including:\\n\\nAs needed to provide our services, such as when we use your information to fulfil your order, to settle disputes, or to provide customer support;\\nwhen you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for our mailing list;\\nif necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law; and as necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as 1) providing and improving our services. We use your information to provide the services you requested and in our legitimate interest to improve our services; and 2) Compliance with the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use. We use your information as necessary to comply with our obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.\\n\\n3. Information Sharing and Disclosure\\n\\nInformation about our customers is important to our business. We share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\\n\\nEtsy. We share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you our services and comply with obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.\\nService providers. We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to our shop, such as delivery companies. We will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.\\nBusiness transfers. If we sell or merge our business, we may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.\\nCompliance with laws. We may collect, use, retain, and share your information if I have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal process or to government requests; (b) enforce our agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our customers, or others.\\n\\n4. Data Retention\\n\\nWe retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with our services and as described in our Privacy Policy. However, we may also be required to retain this information to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. I generally keep your data for the following time period: 4 years.\\n\\n5. Transfers of Personal Information Outside the EU\\n\\nWe may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the US and other jurisdictions. As a result, we may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If we are deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, we rely on Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer, as Google Cloud is Privacy Shield certified.\\n\\n6. Your Rights\\n\\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. We describe these rights below:\\n\\nAccess. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact information below.\\nChange, restrict, delete. You may also have rights to change, restrict our use of, or delete your personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where we are required to store data for legal reasons) we will generally delete your personal information upon request.\\nObject. You can object to (i) our processing of some of your information based on my legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from us after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, we will delete your personal information unless we have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.\\nComplain. If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.\\n\\nHow to contact us:\\n\\nFor purposes of EU data protection law, we, Nicole Bettina Designs, are the data controllers of your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact us at info@nicolebettinadesigns.co.uk.\\n\\nHOW LONG DO THE WALL STICKERS LAST?\\nOur wall decals are made to last for many, many years. If taken care of and applied correctly, your wall sticker will last for at the very least 3 years.\\n\\nCAN YOU REMOVE A WALL STICKER?\\nYes, our stickers are designed to be removable. As our decals are made to stick well to lots of surfaces for multiple years, when you remove your decal some flecks of paint may be removed. Nothing a quick paint job can&#39;t fix.\\n\\nWILL YOUR WALL DECALS STICK TO TEXTURED WALLS?\\nIf your walls are textured, you can still use a wall decal. You can get samples to try if you are not sure how they will look. Please contact us for more information.\\n\\nDOES THE PAINT TYPE MAKE A DIFFERENCE?\\nYes. Although our stickers are designed to stick to almost any surface, some ‘special effect’ paints (light reflecting or eco paints) can be more difficult to apply to because of their chemical properties.',\n",

We use your information to provide the services you requested and in our legitimate interest to improve our services; and 2) Compliance with the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use. We use your information as necessary to comply with our obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.\\u2028\\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\\n\\nInformation about our customers is important to our business. We share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\\n\\n* Etsy. We share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you our services and comply with our obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.\\n* Service Providers. We work together with other companies who provide services to us, such as manufacturing partners, delivery companies, hosting our website, analyzing our website traffic, hosting & providing our cloud services, etc... We only share personal information with these companies if it is necessary for them to provide their services. All companies we work with provide at least industry standard systems and processes to ensure the security and confidentiality of your information.\\n* Business transfers. If we sell or merge our business, we may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.\\n* Compliance with laws. We may collect, use, retain, and share your information if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal process or to government requests; (b) enforce our agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our customers, or others.\\u2028\\nData Retention\\n\\nWe retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with our services and as described in our Privacy Policy. However, we may also be required to retain this information to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. We generally keep your data for the following time period: 4 years.\\n\\nProtection of Personal Information\\n\\nWe take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.\\nWe may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the US and other jurisdictions. As a result, we may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If you use our services, you agree that your information is transmitted, stored, and processed in data centers outside the EU.\\n\\nChildren\\n\\nWe do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will promptly delete this information. Parents or guardians can contact us at privacy@paperpeach.com.\\n\\n3rd Party Sites and Services\\n\\nOur website or any of our services may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the information collected by those third parties and we encourage you to read their privacy policy before submitting any personal information to them.\\n\\nYour Rights\\n\\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. We describe these rights below:\\nAccess. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact information below.\\nChange, restrict, delete. You may also have rights to change, restrict our use of, or delete your personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where we am required to store data for legal reasons) we will generally delete your personal information upon request.\\nObject. You can object to (i) our processing of some of your information based on our legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from us after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, we will delete your personal information unless we have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.\\nComplain. If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.\\n\\nOur Rights\\n\\nWe reserve the right to use any and all designs we’ve created on social media and on our shops or websites and retain all respective copyrights and the protections granted as such unless a separate agreement is reached. We will never include your private information in promotional materials without your express consent.\\n\\nHow to Contact Us\\n\\nFor purposes of EU data protection law, we, Alley9 Creative Studio d.b.a. Paper Peach, are the data controller of your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact us at privacy@paperpeach.com\\n\\nAbout this Privacy Policy\\n\\nOur Privacy Policy may change from time to time. When we change the policy, we will post the changes on this page.\\nIf you have any questions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@paperpeach.com.\\nLast Modified: May 22, 2018\\n\\nWHAT IS THE PROOF TURNAROUND TIME?\\nNot all products offer a proof, but we can typically send one, just let us know!\\n\\nFor products that require a proof, you&#39;ll receive a proof within 1-2 business days. \\n \\nPLEASE be on the lookout for the proof via email. If we do not receive a response your order will be produced as is, and there will be a 2-4 week delay. No changes or refunds may be requested once we have created your stamp or guestbook due to lack of communication on your end. Etsy requires us to meet our stated deadlines. Thank you for your understanding.\\n\\nWHEN WILL YOU RESPOND TO MY MESSAGE?\\nWe respond to inquiries one time per day. I am a mom of three with a photography business on the side, so if I don&#39;t respond immediately, please don&#39;t send multiple messages.\\n\\nIf you have an emergency, please text (do not call) 765.894.0027 with your Etsy order ID.\\n\\nWHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY ORDER?\\nRUBBER STAMPS\\nDue to the current stamp production delays, there is an extended timeline. Your proof will be sent to you via Etsy messages within 1 week. Once you approve the proof, your order will be queued for production. We are estimating approximately 2-3 weeks for production.\\n\\nGUESTBOOKS/PLANNERS/VOW BOOKS\\n3 weeks after your approval (domestic US)\\n1 month (international orders)\\n\\nPlease make sure you have a valid email address associated with your Etsy account so we can reach ya!\\n\\nCAN YOU CHANGE THIS FONT?\\nWe will not change any of the fonts in our designs under any circumstances. \\n\\nMany inexperienced designers create pieces that allow customers to &quot;pick a font.&quot; I don&#39;t work like this. I spend a significant amount of time finding the perfect font for each piece. I have tested these fonts for quality imprints on my products, and I know what works best. When you order from our shop, you can feel confident that you are receiving a high quality, professional design using high quality, professional fonts.\\n\\nI NEED TO CANCEL MY ORDER BEFORE IT SHIPS\\nBecause we begin processing your order as soon as you have ordered, there is a cancellation fee of $10 for stamps and $20 for guestbooks. Cancellation requests must be received within 12 hours of your order.\\n\\nWe spend a lot of time creating your custom proofs, so we do offer a cancellation fee to accommodate our loss of time in creating the design.\\n\\nHOW TO I ORDER?\\nStep 1: Update your email address on your Etsy account. This will ensure that you receive all the lovely & highly informational communications and/or proofs from our shop. \\n\\nStep 2: Place your order with any details in the personalization section.\\n\\nStep 3: If you ordered a guestbook or address stamp, please approve the design proof or request any changes. \\n\\nStep 4: Enjoy your new item and leave a review!\\n\\nI&#39;M CONCERNED ABOUT MY COLORS.\\nUnfortunately, we cannot guarantee that what you see on your monitor is what the printed piece will look like exactly. This is an inherent limitation with digital printing and the differences between each monitor.\\n\\nUH OH!\\n• I found a typo on the product I received. What do I do? We offer complimentary proofs on stamps and guestbooks to try to avoid this very reason. We are only human, after all! We are not responsible for any errors or typos that were approved by you during the proofing process. Please proofread very very carefully! We can offer a reprint at-cost in this situation (if time allows). Contact us privately and directly to work this out.\\n\\n• We are not responsible for shipping to the address you entered upon checkout.  Please take your time reviewing your address while checking out to ensure delivery to the correct location.\\n\\nAREN&#39;T PAPER PRODUCTS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT?\\nSome people think of paper products as dead trees, once they are cut down, they are gone forever! But that’s not actually the case. Some paper forests, like the one Paper Peach uses, are sustainable. When one is cut down, another is planted. So they are actually carbon neutral. If it weren’t for the paper industry, some forests wouldn’t even exist! When paper companies go out of business, so do their forests! The trees are cut down and replaced with other ways to make money. They are replaced by something like a highway, housing, or restaurants. All which have a MASSIVE carbon footprint. No only do the new subdivisions have a higher carbon impact, there is now one less forest to soak up all that carbon. Protect the world with Paper Peach!\\n\\nMY WEDDING DATE CHANGED AFTER I RECEIVED A PRINTED GUESTBOOK\\nBecause our items are made-to-order, we do not offer refunds due to pandemics, tornados, hurricanes, car crashes, family deaths, zombie apocalypses or anything in between.',\n",

Additionally, we have noticed delays in tracking information being updated. The estimated delivery date shown on Etsy is based on your purchase date, your location, and the shipping carrier. Other factors—particularly postal delays that are beyond our control—may end up pushing the arrival of your item beyond the estimated delivery date.

I look forward to hearing what you&#39;d like me to paint, hand letter, or design for you!\\n\\nWHAT IF I GET THE WRONG ITEM, OR MY ORDER IS DAMAGED OR LOST IN SHIPPING?\\nPlease contact me immediately if you receive an order with the wrong item (it rarely happens, but we&#39;re human over here!), or if something strange happens to your order in transit. I can only control so much when it comes to delivery from the Post Office, and I do my best to package your items such that they arrive just as beautifully as they left my shop. If you have any questions or issues regarding your order, just message me and I&#39;ll see how I can help!\\n\\nPlease note: Custom requests cannot be refunded or returned. Once approved by you, I am not responsible for replacing your piece if you find an error after you&#39;ve received it.\\n\\nWHOLESALE AVAILABILITY\\nDo you have a retail shop that would like to sell my work? I would love to coordinate a bulk wholesale order for you! Please message my shop to request wholesale pricing and availability.\\n\\nWHAT IF I LIVE LOCALLY TO YOU? CAN I ARRANGE TO PICK UP MY ORDER INSTEAD OF PAYING FOR SHIPPING?\\nWhen possible, I&#39;d love to coordinate local pick-ups! Some items may not qualify to avoid shipping costs. If you think a local pick-up is possible, message me privately to discuss options.\\n\\nARE ALL OF YOUR CARDS HAND PAINTED?\\nAll of my cards are hand painted, or hand lettered, by me, and then digitized for reprint by a professional printer. Artwork on each card pops as if it was hand-painted as a one-of-a-kind! I&#39;ve worked hard to find the best printing services, and paper selections, to highlight a quality piece of art you&#39;ll be proud to share with your favorite people.\\n\\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\\nI love to package my products so that they are special and fun to receive! Your order will arrive neatly and thoughtfully packaged, whether it&#39;s a gift or just for you.\\n\\nIf you&#39;d like to ship a gift, you may include a gift note, or the note you want me to write inside of a card you purchase through my shop! I will even tie it all up with a ribbon. Just add your gift message to your Shopping Cart Note, or message my shop after purchase, and I&#39;ll make it .\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: Each order will ship to ONE address. I cannot divide an order up between multiple addresses. Please place a separate order for each address you want to send to.\\n\\nDO YOU MAKE CUSTOM MIRROR CLINGS?\\nYes! If you have a group, business, or ministry project in mind, I can design a custom Mirror Cling just for you. A design fee, plus bulk printing costs, will apply, and details will be worked out through direct message. Just message my shop to inquire!\\n\\n*Custom Orders of Mirror Clings require a minimum orders of 35 finished printed clings. Please message for rates and printing quote.\\n\\nSINGLE MIRROR CLINGS: Because my clings are not printed in-house, I do NOT offer one-offs of custom Mirror Cling designs.\\n\\nBULK ORDERS of current designs: If you&#39;d like to order large quantities of Mirror Clings already listed in my shop, please message me about a bulk discount.',\n",

All orders shipped to a Michigan address will be subject to 6% sales tax.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould you wish to cancel an order before it has shipped, convo us and we would be happy to issue a refund. If your package has already shipped, we will issue a refund for the product in question (less shipping costs) after we have received the item back in its original condition. \\r\\n\\r\\nSorry, we are unable to apply coupon codes retroactively to orders that have already been placed. Please take care to verify your information when checking out!',\n",
       "  'policy_shipping': 'PLEASE NOTE: Due to Covid-19 and international supply chain issues, orders may be subject to additional delays that are outside of our control. Please double-check your shipping address during the check-out process to verify that it is correct. We print our shipping labels directly from your receipt, and rely on customers to review and confirm their ship-to address before placing an order. Unfortunately we cannot be held responsible for old or incorrect addresses provided by the customer. Thanks! \\n\\n♥ ORDERS WITHIN THE US\\n\\nOur standard processing time (shipping excluded) is 1-3 business days on all regular orders, or 3-5 business days on orders which include custom handwriting. Please note that during Valentine&#39;s Day or other high volume seasons, additional processing times will apply. When ordering, Etsy will generate an estimated delivery date for your order. This delivery date is not guaranteed, it is simply an estimate based on the shipping speed you selected. \\n\\nStandard shipping, included with every order, is USPS First Class postage. First Class parcels within the continental U.S. typically arrive at their destination within 7-10 business days of being shipped. Please bear in mind that transit times vary depending on your location – we are located in Michigan.\\n\\nWe do offer a few shipping upgrade options in our store for items shipping within the continental U.S.: \\n\\nThe Priority Shipping Upgrade (+ $4) (https://www.etsy.com/listing/101487873/priority-shipping-upgrade-add-on-for) will mean that your items should arrive within 3-4 business days, barring any unforeseen USPS delays. \\n\\nThe Express Shipping Upgrade (+ $22) (https://www.etsy.com/listing/102580272/express-shipping-upgrade-add-on-for) is much more costly, but will guarantee that your items will arrive within 1-2 days.  \\n\\n♥ INTERNATIONAL ORDERS\\n\\nFor international orders, shipping times do vary, and can take 2-4+ weeks, depending on your location. Unfortunately we are unable to track packages once they leave the U.S., and standard international shipping times vary depending on the destination. Inklings is not responsible for hold-ups at customs, or postal delays that are outside of our control.\\n\\nShould you wish for your international order to be rush shipped, please contact us for a custom quote. Priority International Shipping (6-10 business days) can range from $25 - $50 depending on your location and the weight of your package.  \\n\\nWhile it is rare, occasionally additional customs and duty fees do apply. Please note that Inklings is not responsible for any customs fees or duties incurred on international shipments, as these are the responsibility of the purchaser.\\n\\n♥ GENERAL SHIPPING NOTES\\n\\nIf your package is needed by a certain date, we ask that this be noted in your buyer notes, at which point we may recommend that you upgrade your postage in order to ensure your package arrives in time. For time-sensitive orders that are needed within two weeks, we typically recommend Priority Shipping to guarantee their arrival in time. \\n\\nWhile we will do everything within our power to meet your timing, simply noting your event date in your buyer notes does not necessarily guarantee arrival by that date, as we do count on customers reviewing our shipping policies (also found in each listing description) before purchasing to confirm that they have selected the appropriate shipping method that will ensure that their package arrives before their event.\\n\\nWe are not responsible for items that arrive after the date of your event if you decide against upgrading your shipping, or place an order without informing us of your event date. \\n\\nShould you be concerned that your package has become lost in transit or misdelivered, please notify us and we will inquire with the postal carrier about its status. Though it is rare, if your package has indeed been lost in transit due to a fault of the postal carrier, please contact us and we will either issue you a refund or a store credit. We consider an item lost in transit if the tracking has not confirmed that it arrived within 6 weeks of when you ordered.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions on shipping or timing, feel free to contact us directly and we would be happy help!',\n",

If for some reason the items you receive fall short of your expectations, please contact us directly so we can make it right. \\n\\nChange your mind? Simply return your item(s) to us and we will issue a refund after receiving your items in their original condition. \\n\\nDue to their handmade nature, custom-written orders may not be returned unless there is an issue due to our error.\\n\\nFor any items returned to us after 60 days, a $5 re-stocking fee will apply, which will be deducted from your refund amount. For transactions placed through PayPal, we are unfortunately unable to issue a refund (in whole, or in part) after 60 days. In this case, a shop credit may be offered, depending on the circumstances. \\n\\nThough it is rare, if your package has been lost in transit due to a fault of the postal carrier, please contact us and we will either ship a replacement, or issue you a refund. We are unable to provide refunds on orders that are lost or do not arrive due to missing or inaccurate information in the address you provided.\\n\\nPlease note that we cannot be held responsible for orders which arrive after your event due to a last-minute order or inadequate shipping. Please see our shipping policies for details on the optional shipping upgrades we offer.\\n\\nFor custom-designed items or printable files which have already been downloaded, we are unable to accept refunds.\\n\\nWhile we do our best to represent our products accurately in our listing photographs, please understand that the colors do vary between computer monitors.

Thicker options around 110lb - 130lb give cards a premium feel.\\n\\nHOW DO I ACCESS MY DOWNLOADS?\\nYou should receive a link to your download in the email associated with your account OR you can click on your Etsy account profile icon (in top right corner), then Purchases & Reviews, then click the button that says Download Files.',\n",

We are not responsible for late deliveries due to USPS delays, incorrect addresses, lost or stolen packages, or misdeliveries. The customer is responsible for contacting USPS regarding shipment issues. If a package cannot be delivered and is returned to the sender, the customer is responsible for reshipment fees.\\n\\nADDRESS CHANGE\\nIf you need to change the shipping address on your order, let us know right away, and we will do whatever we can to assist you. Unfortunately, we are unable to make any changes once an order has shipped. We are not responsible for items delivered to an incorrect address provided on the order receipt.\\n\\nDELIVERY ISSUES\\nThe first thing to do is to check other possible delivery spots. These include but are not limited to the following: front/back porch, mailbox, parcel locker, under the doormat, behind bushes, and with your neighbors. Postal carriers may scan and mark packages as &quot;delivered&quot; before actual drop off in some cases. Please contact USPS if it has been more than 24 hours since you received a delivery notification.\\n\\nFor lost or stolen packages, the customer is responsible for contacting and filing a claim with USPS. Once the item has been transferred to USPS, we are no longer responsible for any lost or stolen items. Additionally, we are not liable for damages caused by improper handling.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\\nMost international orders are shipped via USPS First Class International, and the price is calculated based on destination.\\n\\nInternational shipments may be subject to import taxes, duties, and customs fees, which are levied once your package reaches the country of destination and is the recipient&#39;s responsibility.\\n\\nRETURNS & EXCHANGES\\nReturned items must be in new, resellable condition in original packaging. Returns are subject to a 15% restocking fee. Refunds will be issued (minus shipping fees) to the original payment method within 1-2 business days after receiving and inspecting the item(s). Buyers are responsible for return shipping costs. If the item is not returned in its original condition, the buyer is responsible for any value loss.\\n\\nSHIPPING NOTICE\\nAll major carriers are experiencing significant shipping delays and have reported unprecedented package increases and limited employee availability due to the impacts of COVID-19. This is causing an increase in errors and tracking inaccuracies. Please continue to purchase as far in advance of needing the product as possible. We appreciate your patience and remain committed to delivering your orders on time.',\n",

Please send a message explaining exactly what you&#39;d like to order, along with specifics (fabric, wording etc) where appropriate. Very importantly, please ensure you let me know where you&#39;re based for shipping, and when you need it by.\\n\\nPlease await a reply and I will advise what&#39;s possible. The more information I have upfront, the quicker I can get back to you.\\n\\nDO YOU OFFER DISCOUNTS?\\nI am a strong believer in &#39;first price, right price&#39; rather than offering items at over inflated prices, and then offering lots of discounts. I have developed products at different price ranges to ensure they&#39;re inclusive, regardless of your budget.\\n\\nSo much care and effort goes into making these items, so I hope you understand that I can&#39;t offer big discounts.\\n\\nWHY SHOULD I CHOOSE OH SQUIRREL ITEMS?\\nWith over 9,000 etsy sales behind Oh Squirrel, and hundreds of returning customers, I know a thing of two about making a special product which will make customers happy.

Please make sure to read the &quot;processing time&quot; for the item. Always feel free to message me and I can let you know if I will be able to accommodate your request.

My shop runs on customized items and custom listings.\\n\\nDO YOUR ITEMS COME WITH DISPLAY PIECES - LIKE IN THE LISTING PHOTOS?\\nNo, all of my items are the hand lettered pieces only. The majority of the listing photos are the professional photos I receive from the client in the manner they themselves have decided to display their hand lettered items from me (scrolls, table numbers, place cards, etc).\\n\\nDO YOU OFFER REFUNDS?\\nDue to the customization nature of my products, refunds are not offered.',\n",

As with anything handmade, please understand that natural wear and tear may occur. I am not responsible for any damaged items due to improper care. As with any vinyl item, picking at the item will result in the vinyl coming loose or tearing.\\n\\nCUSTOM AND PERSONALIZED ORDERS\\nI have no issue fulfilling a custom and personalized order! Due to the nature of the item, I may not be able to accept a return or a refund.  Please understand that with each custom and personalized order, the shipping times may be longer than listed, based on the size of the order, the order materials, and other orders that I may have to fulfill. If you have more than a few items that need to be customized, please message me first to see if you can get your items on time. I try my best to fulfil orders, but I also work a job where I am subject to being on call, and may not be able to fulfill large orders within 3-5 business days.\\n\\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\\nCurrently, I do not gift wrap any items. I try my best to secure each package with love and care, so that it gets to you safely and sweetly. If you would like the invoice and pricing to not be included in the package, click the gift option, or shoot me a message. Each item is sent with bubble wrap, paper/packing peanuts and high quality boxes.\\n\\nCAN I SEND YOU A PHOTO FROM PINTEREST/ONLINE OF SOMEONE ELSE&#39;S WORK FOR YOU TO MAKE?\\nI love doing custom work, but I will not copy anyone&#39;s work. I may do something similar, but my calligraphy is unique to me, as well as my small doodles/drawings. I may be inspired to make something you will love, but I will not copy anyone&#39;s work. I believe in community instead of competition, if you feel the one you found on pinterest is best, I recommend buying from that shop!\\n\\nWHOLESALE AVAILABILITY\\nUnfortunately, I do not offer wholesale items at this time.\\n\\nSHIPPING TIMES\\nThe ship times are an estimate, and may not be exact. Depending on how many orders I have in queue, your order may be shipped immediately or on the 5th business day. Larger orders may take longer, but I will try my best. Please understand that I have a full time job, and currently cannot devote more than nights and weekends to Simply Vicotera. If you need a package sooner, ask and I will do expedited shipping, for an extra cost. If you are concerned about when a package will arrive, just shoot me a message.\\n\\nARE YOUR ITEMS AVAILABLE IN A SHOP?\\nCurrently, a few of my items are located at Journey Jewelers, in Oklahoma City, OK. Prices may vary at the retailer, but you will supporting two local businesses, instead of just one! Items can be ordered and picked up there for a higher price, but it will still be cheaper than shipping.\\n\\nI also try to do 3-5 shows in the OKC metro area. Dates are listed on my social media pages. I have no problem making certain items, or even custom items, if you are willing to travel to pick up the item. However, if items are not picked up, traditional purchasing online with shipping will be required.',\n",

I will create and email your custom file to you within 24 hours.\\n\\nWHAT TYPES OF PAPER DO YOU RECOMMEND PRINTING MY DOWNLOADED FILE ON?\\nOptions range from poster paper, to gloss, matte, and semi-gloss. \\n\\nGloss will have a lot of sheen and reflection, matte is a more natural feel similar to paper surface, and I personally prefer semi-gloss as it&#39;s the best of both worlds and more vibrant in my opinion.\\n\\nSome print shops will even print on watercolour paper if you love that texture and want a truly authentic looking print closest to the original watercolour painting!\\n\\nDO YOU TAKE COMMISSION REQUESTS FOR WATERCOLOUR FINE ART PIECES?\\nAbsolutely! Depending on the time of year and the complexity of the project, the timeline for completion may vary.

       "  'policy_additional': 'FAQs-\\nQ.) How do I edit my Instant Download Template?\\n\\nA.) Simply download the file by clicking on the download link that Etsy gives you after purchase and open it in Adobe Reader.  Click on the text that needs to be changed and type in your information.  If you need to change the font size, font type or wish to change the font color press:  the Ctrl (or Command on a mac) key and the letter E key at the same time and the Edit menu will pop up.  Text that is editable will be highlighted in the product listing.  Make sure you are editing on a computer, not your phone.  (It&#39;s not generally recommended to edit on your tablet, but I tried on my personal tablet and was able to, so it may be possible depending on model.)\\n\\nPlease note that some files may require a font download for the file to look the same as the listing photo if you don&#39;t already have the font installed.  When permitted by font license I have included the font file with the product download.  If I cannot bundle the font with the product, I have included a file with a link to the download page of the font.  Only free fonts are used and download and installation of a font takes seconds.  After installing the font you will have it on your computer to use on any future projects you make.  \\n\\nIf you don&#39;t already have Adobe PDF Reader on your computer get it for free here: https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/pdf-reader.html\\n\\nQ.) What is a digital proof?\\n\\nA.)  Digital proofs are a sample of what your product will look like, if there is anything you&#39;d like changed on it contact us upon reviewing the file.  They will be etsy messeged to you within 48 hours of payment.  Digital proofs are lower resolution than the final product.   \\n\\nQ.)  How should I cut the files? \\n\\nA.)  DIY Cutting the files--  I highly suggest using a paper trimmer.  Staples and FedEx Kinkos have paper trimmers in shop that you can use.  These shops can also cut the stack for you and typically charge about $1/cut (whole stack at once) to do it for you.  You could always use an exacto knife/ boxcutter & ruler in a pinch, but easier to get a 50% off coupon to a chain craft store and get a nice little paper trimmer to keep and love forever.  (I use mine ALL THE TIME)\\n\\nQ.)  I want to upload these to a different printing site and need a file type and size that is not included in the downloaded template.  What can I do?\\n\\nA.)  Since these files are intended for the the DIY printer at home file requirements for a professional online printer will be slightly different.  Please contact me via etsy messenger with your requirements and I will respond ASAP.  I can resize the file for you, with bleed if needed and resave as a different file type for you and email you what you need.  You can email me your filled in template at: Foxyprintables [at] gmail.com.  I will get back to you as soon as possible. \\n\\nQ.)  Can I pay you to print them for me?\\n\\nA.)  Sorry, at this time I do not offer printing services.\\n\\nQ.)  Can I share my file with someone else?\\n\\nA,)  You have a license to use them for your personal use, so please print out as many as you need, but please refer your friend to my store so she can purchase her own files.

I offer a custom line of cards that are completely made by hand from scratch as well as a line of cards and boxed sets of prints from my original artwork. I strive to fulfill 1Thessalonians 5:11 &quot;Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.&quot; by offering sentiments for all life has to offer us (Ecclesiastes 3:1-8)',\n",

Though I always put orders in the outgoing mailbox the day that your shipping confirmation is sent, it can sometimes take a day or two for USPS to collect and scan your item in. Additionally - please keep an eye on your tracking details! It is rare, but if it is taking more than a week from your ship date to receive your item or you notice it not budging for a week at a time, we may have some lost mail on our hands, and I&#39;d love to help. Please make sure to reach out if this is the case!\\r\\n\\r\\n** Due to COVID-19 craziness, please be aware that many shipping carriers are experiencing delays. USPS has notified us that their &#39;expected shipping times&#39; have all been extended by a day or two, so items may take just a hint longer to arrive than usual. **\\r\\n',\n",

I use your information to provide the services you requested and in my legitimate interest to improve my services; and 2) Compliance with the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use. I use your information as necessary to comply with my obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.\\n\\n\\nINFORMATION SHARING & DISCLOSURE:\\n\\nInformation about my customers is important to my business. I share your personal information for VERY limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\\n\\n* Etsy. I share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you my services and comply with my obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.\\n* Service providers. I engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to my shop, such as delivery companies. I will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.\\n* Business transfers. If I sell or merge my business, I may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.\\n* Compliance with laws. I may collect, use, retain, and share your information if I have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal process or to government requests; (b) enforce my agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of my customers, or others.\\n\\n\\nDATA RETENTION\\n\\nI retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with my services and as described in my Privacy Policy.

I generally keep your data for the following time period: 4 years.\\n\\n\\nTRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFO OUTSIDE THE EU\\n\\nI may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the US and other jurisdictions. As a result, I may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If I am deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, I rely on Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer, as Google Cloud is Privacy Shield certified.\\n\\n\\nYOUR RIGHTS\\n\\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. I describe these rights below:\\n\\n* Access. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information I hold about you by contacting me using the contact information below.\\n* Change, restrict, delete. You may also have rights to change, restrict my use of, or delete your personal information.

You can object to (i) my processing of some of your information based on my legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from me after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, I will delete your personal information unless I have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.\\n* Complain.

You may also choose to provide me with additional personal information (for any custom work or custom shipping), if you contact me directly.\\n\\n\\nWHY I NEED YOUR INFORMATION & HOW I USE IT:\\n\\nI rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including:\\n\\n* as needed to provide my services, such as when I use your information to fulfil your order, to settle disputes, or to provide customer support;\\n* when you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for my mailing list (which can only be done directly through www.katfrenchdesign.com);\\n* if necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law; and\\nas necessary for the purpose of my legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as 1) providing and improving my services. I use your information to provide the services you requested and in my legitimate interest to improve my services; and 2) Compliance with the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use. I use your information as necessary to comply with my obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.\\n\\n\\nINFORMATION SHARING & DISCLOSURE:\\n\\nInformation about my customers is important to my business. I share your personal information for VERY limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\\n\\n* Etsy. I share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you my services and comply with my obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.\\n* Service providers. I engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to my shop, such as delivery companies. I will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.\\n* Business transfers. If I sell or merge my business, I may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.\\n* Compliance with laws. I may collect, use, retain, and share your information if I have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal process or to government requests; (b) enforce my agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of my customers, or others.\\n\\n\\nDATA RETENTION\\n\\nI retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with my services and as described in my Privacy Policy. However, I may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce my agreements. I generally keep your data for the following time period: 4 years.\\n\\n\\nTRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFO OUTSIDE THE EU\\n\\nI may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the US and other jurisdictions. As a result, I may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If I am deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, I rely on Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer, as Google Cloud is Privacy Shield certified.\\n\\n\\nYOUR RIGHTS\\n\\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. I describe these rights below:\\n\\n* Access. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information I hold about you by contacting me using the contact information below.\\n* Change, restrict, delete. You may also have rights to change, restrict my use of, or delete your personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where I am required to store data for legal reasons) I will generally delete your personal information upon request.\\n* Object. You can object to (i) my processing of some of your information based on my legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from me after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, I will delete your personal information unless I have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.\\n* Complain. If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about my use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.\\n\\n\\nHOW TO CONTACT ME\\n\\nFor purposes of EU data protection law, I, Kat French, am the data controller of your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact me at kat@katfrenchdesign.com. Alternately, you may mail me at:\\n\\nKat French, PO BOX 270385, Flower Mound, TX 75027-0385',\n",

You may also choose to provide me with additional personal information (for a custom order of a wedding invitation, for example), if you contact me directly. \\n\\nWhy I Need Your Information and How I Use It\\n\\nI rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including:\\n\\n- as needed to provide my services, such as when I use your information to fulfil your order, to settle disputes, or to provide customer support;\\n- when you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for my mailing list;\\n- if necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law; and\\n- as necessary for the purpose of my legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as 1) providing and improving my services.

I use your information as necessary to comply with my obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.\\n\\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\\n\\nInformation about my customers is important to my business. I share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\\n\\n    Etsy. I share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you my services and comply with my obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.\\n    Service providers. I engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to my shop, such as delivery companies. I will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.\\n    Business transfers. If I sell or merge my business, I may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.\\n    Compliance with laws. I may collect, use, retain, and share your information if I have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal process or to government requests; (b) enforce my agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of my customers, or others.\\n\\nData Retention\\n\\nI retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with my services and as described in my Privacy Policy. However, I may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce my agreements. I generally keep your data for the following time period: 4 years. \\n\\nTransfers of Personal Information Outside the EU\\n\\nI may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the US and other jurisdictions. As a result, I may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If I am deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, I rely on Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer, as Google Cloud is Privacy Shield certified.\\n\\nYour Rights\\n\\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. I describe these rights below:\\n\\n- Access. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information I hold about you by contacting me using the contact information below.\\n- Change, restrict, delete. You may also have rights to change, restrict my use of, or delete your personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where I am required to store data for legal reasons) I will generally delete your personal information upon request.\\n- Object. You can object to (i) my processing of some of your information based on my legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from me after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, I will delete your personal information unless I have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.\\n- Complain. If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about my use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.\\n\\nHow to Contact Me\\n\\nFor purposes of EU data protection law, I, Laura Rodger, am the data controller of your personal information.
