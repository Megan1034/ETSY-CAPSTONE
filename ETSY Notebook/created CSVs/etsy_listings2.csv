WHY BUY FROM TRAVELING CALLIGRAPHER?

Hi, I&#39;m Queeny, one-woman show running Traveling Calligrapher. Each map and product is made with all my heart and soul. Each map is made to embody the unique characteristics of a city. Some maps take around 2 weeks and some take a year or more to research, sketch, and letter. The process for each map has had a slightly different approach, but most of the time it starts with a memory, a specific person, or a nostalgic emotion. If my maps evoke fond memories in you, remind you of someone, or just give you a joyful feeling, I&#39;ve done my job!

I am so proud of our over 866 5-Star Reviews. See what our past customers have to say about our handcrafted products and customer service https://www.etsy.com/shop/tcalligrapher/reviews

Traveling Calligrapher has been creating handcrafted, personalized maps since 2015 and all the items you see in this shop are created from start to finish in California. We only use American-made materials and eco-friendly materials & packaging whenever possible.

47,1146314900,116023410,15697985,Handmade Colorshifting Watercolors - Fairy Collection Sets,"The Fairy Collection Set is an extremely sparkly and colorshifting watercolor paints.  These paints have so much sparkle in them and they may take a bit more water to keep them activated to keep them from getting chunky! . They are more of pastel in color and can be a bit thick and may take some time to learn how to use them.  Colorshift colors work best in my opinion on black watercolor paper, but these also are gorgeous on white as well.  If you have any questions on how to use them, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.  The Collection is made up of 7 pans in 3 different sizes, half, quarter and mini. The set has cute little Fairy names, Chepi, Luna, Aubri, Tinka, Calulla, Pixie and Adelina!
Half pans hold 2 ml, quarter are 1ml and mini holds .5ml of paint, however all are pillow topped offering more paint!  Yay!!!

All of my pigments are ethically sourced as they are manmade.  My binder consists of gum arabic, glycerin, essential oil and a small amount of honey.  You will not find any fillers in my paints! My watercolor paints are great for artists of many varieties and can be used by beginner to professional artist grade talent.  

I live in the Midwest and because of shipping conditions, I highly recommend that you pop your watercolor pans in the freezer for 15-30 minutes in case it has become soft in transit.  I do package with silica gel packets in the attempt to prevent the heat from softening them.  If you follow my advice, your paints will be fine!  

Full pans, half pans and quarter pans all come with magnets. Mini’s do not! 

*Disclosure* It is completely normal for air bubbles and pockets to occur in the drying process.  I make every effort to remove all air bubbles, but I cannot see inside of the pan!  This seems to be more common in the chunkier, more glittery pigments!  I fill each pan with 3-5 layers, and I pillow top all pans, even the minis!  Overfilling will compensate for any bubbles that decided not to come to the surface and it in no way effects your beautiful paints!

Another tip when going to use your paints, I recommend that you add several drops of water and allow a minute or two to pass before attempting to paint.  This will allow your paint to soften up and give you the best pigmented results! Some paints will require a bit more water to fully activate, depending on the pigment. Last but absolutely not least, do not store your pans while they are still wet!  Moisture and darkness lead to mold, which no one wants!  Let them completely dry out before storage.

This Is To Ensure Delivery To The Correct Address. I Will Pay The Additional Fee To Protect Your Purchase From Being Delivered To An Incorrect Address.

This Is Also To Protect You From Package Theft Or Having Your High Value Invitations Damaged During Heavy Rainfall And Inclement Weather If Left Outside.
 
If You Have Your Invitations Sent To A Business Address, YOUR Signature & Proof Of Identification Will Be Required.  Only YOU May Sign For It.  Packages Sent To Business Addresses Get Handled By Too Many People & More Often Than Not...GET LOST.  I Do Not Recommend This Method At All.  This Method Will Not Cover Any Lost Packages With A Signature That Does Not Match Your Own.  It Must Be YOUR Signature.  Please Reach Out To Me For More Details.
 
If You Know You Will Not Be Home On The Day Of Expected Delivery, Please Make Sure You Contact USPS To Have Them Re-Deliver On A Day You Will Be Home OR Have Them Hold Your Package At The Post Office For Pick Up.  If You Hold For Pick Up, The Name On The Package Is The Only Person Who Can Pick It Up Per USPS Policy.  They Will Require Proof Of Identification For You To Pick Up Your Package.  Please Make Sure The Name & Address On The Shipping Label Will Match The Identification Of The Person Picking It Up.

In The Event You Decline Signature Service & Your Package Is Delivered To An Incorrect Address, Stolen, Or Damaged During Inclement Weather, I Am Not Responsible For Re-Sending A Replacement Or Refunding You.

Trademarking is becoming an increasingly abused method of online sellers attempting to corner the market on trending words, phrases, and/or shapes. These will be registered in product classes such as Clothing, Mugs, Greeting cards, Posters etc. This means you are not allowed to use these words and phrases to make items for sale in those classes despite the designs being entirely different and not competing in the same market. I can only advise that if you intended on creating commercial items that you do your own research in the TESS database [Trademark Electronic Search System] in order to find out if your desired word or phrase is trademark protected in a class that you are selling.

&lt;&lt;Your purchase includes&gt;&gt;
•One 300 DPI  PDF 
•One 300 DPI PNG file with cut lines via a white border around the elements
both sized for 6.75x9.25 (but they can be scaled up or down as long as you keep the proportions the same. Let me know if you need help on doing that.) 

&lt;&lt;&lt;PLEASE NOTE&gt;&gt;&gt;
**Note: make sure you have the most recent version of the Cricut/Silhouette Design software or the cut lines might not show. 
•Colors on your printed files may differ from the colors seen on the listing as all printers vary with their tonal range. The better the printer, typically the better the output; Canon printers typically print cooler. Your purchase will result in downloadable / printable / digital files. No physical file will be sent. All files included in this listing are original items created using commercially licensed brushes and stamps or with original artwork. Copyright belongs to PlanItDarbi. 
•Files purchased are only for PERSONAL USE ONLY and must not be RESOLD or used on products other than stickers. Contact me if you need a license for using it differently. Due to the nature of this product, all purchases are NON-REFUNDABLE. You may not share or distribute these files in any form. 

 
&lt;&lt;&lt;HOW THIS WORKS&gt;&gt;&gt;
1. Add which stickers you want to your Etsy cart.
2. Choose payment method. Once that is confirmed, tap on the VIEW FILES link to go to the DOWNLOADS page. An email will also be sent to you with the link. You can always find your files under the PURCHASES tab. (You must visit that page in your browser, not the app, at the time of this posting Feb 2022)
3. Save the files to your device and then open through whatever app or software that you use for printing. 

 4A {{For PDF printing--NO CUTTING MACHINE NEEDED}}
•Save the PDF (you can do PNG as well) to your device. You will need 8.5x11 paper (recommended 28# or 32# bright white paper, or ONLINE LABELS matte or matte clear sticker/label paper) loaded in your color printer. Make sure you have a PDF reader installed if using that file. If you don’t, get one at  https://get.adobe.com/reader/).
• {{Options may vary based on program and operating system}}
·   	Select PRINT option from the FILE menu, and on the pop-up window.
·   	Make sure the box for GRAYSCALE is NOT checked.
·   	Under ORIENTATION, choosing AUTO will position the image in the center of the page. This is a safe option if you are having issues with elements along the margin being cut off. Otherwise choose PORTRAIT.
·   	For the size, if you want it to print in the intended size, choose ACTUAL SIZE. Otherwise, you can shrink/enlarge it based on your preferences by adjusting the percentage. I personally like printing at 75% for classic-sized planners. For minis, 50% may work best. 100% is good for BIG sized.  Just experiment --that&#39;s the beauty of printables!
• Please know that your color output on the final product will vary from what you see on the screen. This is affected by which printer you have, what ink you use, how much ink you have, and which paper you use.
•After you&#39;ve finished printing, cut the elements out by hand and paste to your printer spread using glue or crafter&#39;s tape.
 
4B {{FOR PRINTING, THEN CUTTING with CRICUT, SILHOUETTE, etc}}
When necessary, I included cut lines via a white border around the designed elements but I know some machines are finicky. Refer to your software manual/machine interface instructions to go from here as it varies per brand. Print on sticker paper (see below for my recommended products).
• After saving the PNG files to your device, upload the PNG File to the design space for your cutter (Silhouette vs. Cricut etc). You will need to select PRINT THEN CUT when uploading. The botton/wording may vary across programs.
• Input the size you prefer.NOTE: recommended to print at 75%/5 in x 6.852in/12.7x17.4 cm for classic-sized planners. Leave them at their original size (6.75x9.25) or a bit bigger for BIG sizes, and so on. Go smaller, such as 50% for mini sizes. JUST PLEASE KEEP IT IN THE SAME PROPORTIONS...lock your aspect-ration so the images don&#39;t appear smooshed or stretched.  Resizing instructions for Cricut: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xr4G6NBcCc   Resizing instructions for Silhouette: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwrZnLRf0sA
• Please know that your color output on the final product will vary from what you see on the screen. This is affected by which printer you have, ink status, and as paper choice.
• Follow the specific process for your cutting-machine design space to adjust/print/cut...making sure to double check the cut lines and margins.
• You can put two full sticker sheets on one if you proportionately shrink the png file (in portrait mode); just make sure in your cutting design-space that you lock the aspect ratio so the end result is not squished/distorted.
• Please know that your color output on the final product will vary from what you see on the screen. This is affected by which printer you have, ink status as well as paper.

Measuring HEIGHT- The &#39;baseline&#39; of a name is the line a name is formed on.  Some names have letters that drop below the &#39;baseline&#39; such as Megan with the &#39;g&#39;.  These letters(f, g, j, p, q, y) that drop below the baseline are included in the measurement of the name.  Therefore, the name Megan will be measured from the bottom of the &#39;g&#39; to the top of the M where as Anna would only be calculated from the baseline to the specified height as Anna does not have any letter that drops below the &#39;baseline&#39;. If you have any question regarding the size of a name please contact me.  A 3” high name will be very large.

If you have a name that is 2 words please select quantity of 2.
For example, Anna Grace is 2 words therefore you would select 2 in the quantity drop down menu.  A date counts as one word, 05/23/19.
Maximum letters per name is 12.

Due to the unique nature of every piece of wood, there may be some variations in the wood grain and character of each item you receive. If you are needing a very clean piece of wood with no knots or &quot;character&quot; if you&#39;re planning on leaving it raw, please let us know when placing the order. We do our best to find and use the prettier parts of the plywood, but sometimes there are more variations than others. 

Each wood cutout will have a smooth brown edge.  In the case of excess residue, simply use a rag to gently wipe away as needed around edges. We find that the use of a dry rag is best. This residue will eventually wear off completely. The back side of our cutouts will have some amount of burn from the laser grid. 																				

There may be a texture on the wood. This can be lightly sanded off for a smoother finish or works great as is, too.

We are slowly editing all of our listings to include other material types- we have 1/8&quot; birch plywood, 1/8&quot; MDF, 1/4&quot; MDF, and 3/8&quot; birch plywood as additional options. Prices vary. If you&#39;re interested in something other than 1/4&quot; birch plywood and do not see it as an option to purchase on this listing, please message us and we can get you a price and edit the listing for you.

Trademarking is becoming an increasingly abused method of online sellers attempting to corner the market on trending words, phrases, and/or shapes.

I can only advise that if you intended on creating commercial items that you do your own research in the TESS database [Trademark Electronic Search System] in order to find out if your desired word or phrase is trademark protected in a class that you are selling.

This Is To Ensure Delivery To The Correct Address. I Will Pay The Additional Fee To Protect Your Purchase From Being Delivered To An Incorrect Address.

This Is Also To Protect You From Package Theft Or Having Your High Value Invitations Damaged During Heavy Rainfall And Inclement Weather If Left Outside.
 
If You Have Your Invitations Sent To A Business Address, YOUR Signature & Proof Of Identification Will Be Required.  Only YOU May Sign For It.  Packages Sent To Business Addresses Get Handled By Too Many People & More Often Than Not...GET LOST.  I Do Not Recommend This Method At All.  This Method Will Not Cover Any Lost Packages With A Signature That Does Not Match Your Own.  It Must Be YOUR Signature.  Please Reach Out To Me For More Details.
 
If You Know You Will Not Be Home On The Day Of Expected Delivery, Please Make Sure You Contact USPS To Have Them Re-Deliver On A Day You Will Be Home OR Have Them Hold Your Package At The Post Office For Pick Up.  If You Hold For Pick Up, The Name On The Package Is The Only Person Who Can Pick It Up Per USPS Policy.  They Will Require Proof Of Identification For You To Pick Up Your Package.  Please Make Sure The Name & Address On The Shipping Label Will Match The Identification Of The Person Picking It Up.
 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IF YOU DECLINE SIGNATURE SERVICE&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

In The Event You Decline Signature Service & Your Package Is Delivered To An Incorrect Address, Stolen, Or Damaged During Inclement Weather, I Am Not Responsible For Re-Sending A Replacement Or Refunding You. I Will Only Take Responsibility With The Signature Service Agreement. This Is For YOUR Protection & MY Protection.

ATTENTION: At Magnum designs, we prefer to complete any design project within three months post-purchase.

149,165393998,85278,5137177,Womens Organic Cotton T Shirt - Womens Graphic Tee - Gray Crew Neck Tee Shirt - Japanese Haiku Design Screen Printed Shirt,"I specially designed this womens organic cotton t shirt with the victims of the recent Japanese earthquake and tsunami in mind.

The tee shirt depicts the islands of Matsushima (meaning the &quot;Pine
Islands&quot; in Japanese) near Sendai along with a well-known Japanese haiku often
attributed (although erroneously) to Matsuo Basho, expressing the
poet&#39;s loss of words at viewing the islands.

Matsushima!
Ah, Matsushima!
Matsushima!

Matsushima, traditionally considered to be one of the 3 most scenic
spots in all of Japan, is representative of the beauty of the region
of northeastern Japan that was hit in the earthquake and tsunami.

The calligraphy was done by my mom, who lives safely in another part of Japan!

Tired of the doorbell going off and interrupting your work flow, waking the baby, or causing the dogs to bark their heads off?! This cute sign can help! 

Simple, elegant and straight forward, this handmade sign is sure to get the message across to delivery drivers, neighborhood solicitors, and even remind the guests you are expecting that the doorbell is for decorative purposes only. The sign is lightweight, and easily readable at 7inX3in in size.

During checkout, you can choose to have the two holes (as shown in the photos) cut into the sign to easily loop a ribbon through- or if you plan to prop the sign up, you can choose to have no holes, for a flush sign. Read on for details regarding the item specifications, hanging options, and gift wrapping options.

DETAILS
◉The sign measures in 7.5in wide, 3in tall, and 1/4in thick 
◉The sign is handmade using a laser engraving machine, after being hand drawn
◉Sign is single layered, lightweight and easily hangable 


HANGING OPTIONS
◉Choose from our four different hanging options:
&gt;&gt;Option 1: two loop holes for stringing a ribbon through to hang- ribbon NOT included
&gt;&gt;Option 2: two loop holes for stringing a ribbon through- pictured ribbon included
&gt;&gt;Option 2: no holes in the sign, prop/use your own adhesive
&gt;&gt;Option 3: no holes in the sign, double sided adhesive included


GIFT WRAPPING
◉Gift wrapping is available for an additional fee! Your item comes bubble wrapped in a box or mailer, but if you choose the gift wrapping option, I will additionally wrap the item with brown wrapping paper and include a twine ribbon.

INSTRUCTIONS:

HOW TO INSTALL THE FONT ON PC OR MAC:

Unzip your font folder and double click on the font to install it.

*For Ipad and iPhone users, you can search on the &quot;app store&quot; some free &quot;font manager&quot; app, it is 100% compatible on IPad and iPhone as well.

CRICUT AND SILHOUETTE:

Please note. I do not offer support for Cricut, however, I provide you with some instructions bellow that might help you.

HOW TO UPLOAD FONTS TO CRICUT DESIGN SPACE ON PC:

1.
Unzip your font folder.

2.
Locate the font file inside the font folder. Your font file will be either an OpenType Format (OTF) or a TrueType format (TTF). Double-click it!
Once you double-click the font file, an installation window appears. Just click Install.
Congratulations! Your font is now installed.
Now, the trick to using it in Cricut Design Space is to be sure you RELOAD Design Space before you try to find the font. That usually means just clicking the refresh icon in your browser.

Once Cricut Design Space is reloaded, click the Text icon, type some text, click the Fonts menu, make sure the word “All” is highlighted, and type in the first few letters of the new font you uploaded — when your font appears, click it to apply it to your text!

And that’s it!

Download the font to your iPad or iPhone.

iFont should open with the Open Zip Archive screen. You should then be directed back to iFont. On the left, you’ll see an option to Install the Maker Penwriting Regular font. Tap the Install button. You’ll be guided through a series of menus. Tap Allow. Settings should open showing a window to Install Profile. Tap Install. You may be prompted for your device’s passcode. You may have to tap install a couple more times to complete the process. You should see a screen that says Profile Installed. Tap Done. The font is now installed on your device.

Restart the Cricut Design Space app. Click on the text at the bottom. Click on the All tab because of the app defaults to the Cricut tab. Type in the name of the font you just installed. Tap on it. You should now be back at the Canvas screen. Type in text to see what it looks like.

TIMING
----------

I pride myself in providing quick and efficient service, and most customers have their stamps in hand within 5-7 business days after ordering (excludes Sat and Sun). Once I receive your order, you will receive a mock-up within 1-2 business days. After the mockup is approved for production, it takes 1-2 days for the stamp to ship. After that, it&#39;s up the post office to deliver to you in a timely manner.

At checkout, you can choose either first-class shipping, which typically takes 5-7 business days (although is sometimes faster!), or you can upgrade to priority mail which takes 2-3 business days depending on your location.  However, these delivery times are not guaranteed by the post office.Does your hand cramp up at the thought of writing your return address 100s of times?  Mine does!

DETAILS
------------

First, choose either a wood stamp or a self-inking stamp.  I personally love the wood stamps, because you can change ink colors at will!  Wood stamps arrive with handle installed.  You can also choose to add on a standard felt ink pad in blue, red, or black!

The self-inking stamps are the highly respected Trodat brand.  Choose from a variety of colorful inks, which will last for up to 10,000 impressions!  Note that you cannot easily change ink colors with self-inking stamps.

Next, enter the desired name and address exactly as you&#39;d like it to appear on the stamp. I will contact you within 1-3 business days with a digital proof of your design.

Once you approve your proof, the stamp will be delivered to you in about 5-7 business days!

This stamp is roughly 1&quot;x2.5&quot;, depending on your exact text. Stamp previews shows an accurate size on a 5×7″ envelope.

Whilst I love that most of my customers can use these straight out the box, I understand that occasionally some customers would prefer an edit here or there.  So if you’re looking for the calligraphy sections to be reworded, the text color to be changed, a completely different size of template, or you’re just a bit of a technophobe and would rather me edit these for you, then I&#39;ve got you covered.  For each design in the bundle that you&#39;d like edited, then all you need to do is add on an &#39;edit my listing&#39; over here: https://etsy.me/2MgQJkW then just let me know exactly which design and size you’d like edited, so for example  if you’d like the Invitation, Directions, and Accommodations card in another color, simply add on three ‘edit my listings’.  Full details of what can be achieved are on the ‘edit my listing’ page, so have a read and if you have a question then, by all means, get in touch.

♥♥♥ HOW TO APPLY♥♥♥
Recommendations for applying the labels with optimal adhesion: 

- Clean your hands and the destination surface. Any debris, dust, moisture, or natural oils can interfere with the adhesive, weakening the bond.  If soap solution has spilled and dried on the containers and these are not cleaned, the stickers won&#39;t stick or they will start to pill off right after applying them.

- Apply the center of the label first and then work out toward the edges. This reduces some of the tension on the ends of the label which will help it stay down.

- Use pressure when sticking the labels to your surface. Our products are pressure-sensitive, so more pressure equates to a stronger bond.

♥♥♥ HOW TO ORDER ♥♥♥

***PLEASE READ BEFORE ORDERING:  This listing is for LABELS ONLY, containers ARE NOT included***

Refunds/Cancellations/Exchanges are not accepted due to lack of reading description and Listing Title. &gt;THIS LISTING IS FOR SUBLIMATION TRANSFER ONLY – READ FULL DETAILS BEFORE ORDERING&lt;&lt;

Our transfers come ready to heat press and will not have water-markings. BRKreationsBoutique takes pride in using only the highest quality sublimation printer inks and paper. They have been tested and proven to provide the best quality prints onto sublimation materials when applied properly. This is a great alternative to using vinyl! No more weeding or buying vinyl! HEAT PRESS IS REQUIRED - CANNOT USE IRON.

📌Sublimation can be done on LIGHT colored fabric, containing at least 65% polyester. The higher the polyester count, the better!

📌 TO ORDER
•Choose Transfer Size
-Youth 7” - 8”
-Adult 8.5” - 11”

**ASK FOR BULK ORDER PRICES**

These measurements are an estimate and might vary slightly. This measurement will be for the widest part of the image. If you have any questions or want to order a custom size, or design, message us!

📌DISCLAIMER
Please do your research on sublimation prior to ordering as we are not responsible for any pressing errors. If done correctly, you image will be bold and vibrant. If your image is faded or washes out, you did not follow instructions. Colors may vary slightly from monitor. This listing is for SUBLIMATION transfers only. (NOT SCREEN PRINTS)

📌RETURNS/EXCHANGES
Due to the nature of the product, we do not allow returns or exchanges. If there is an issue with your order, please contact us within 5 days of receiving your order! It is your responsibility to look over prints before pressing.

📌Most transfers ship SAME or NEXT day! We are not responsible for shipping delays.

Have question? Message us! We are happy to help.The initial print coming out of the printer and to you may be dull and looks faded.

It is important to note that this is perfectly fine and in fact shows us that we are on the right track. 

The reason for this dull or faded looking print coming out of your printer is that sublimation ink is only activated at 392 degrees Farenhieht , and when placed under sufficient pressure. In other words, the correct colour will only appear on the final sublimated product – after you have completed the sublimation process carefully.

CHANGES/CUSTOMS

I and my team have vast knowledge on parchment (and leather); it is our family business going back a few generations. If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me. 

SOME USEFUL TIPS FOR WORKING WITH PARCHMENT:
-Polishing the back of the parchment with a dry cloth before writing or printing prevents ink bleedings.
-To make calligraphy corrections, use a precision knife or a scouring pad rather than sandpaper. They are kinder to parchment than the sandpaper. 
- White or natural parchment are more suitable for painting than the antique parchment; colors are more vibrant on lighter toned parchment.
-Secure the parchment sheet on a wooden surface with drawing pins while painting, and wait until the paint dries completely before removing them.
-You can use matt acrylic varnish spray to seal all types of paint and ink.
-After printing on parchment, let it dry for 24 hours before using varnish.
- If the parchment artwork is to be framed, mount it on 3mm thick MDF rather than paper. Paper and parchment react differently to temperature changes and humidity.
-To flatten rolled parchment, put heavy books on them and wait for a couple of days.",active,1655347367,1655347367,1665888167,1544559260,1655347367,1655347367,1645375033,558,29089702,-1,https://www.etsy.com/listing/666599661/antique-goatskin-parchment-vellum-real,711,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,256,"Please tell me how you are planning to use your parchment (e.g. bookbinding, calligraphy etc), so I can send you the best one for your project.

As you might know, there are not many brush options out there when it comes to this style. In fact, I’ve purchased every gothic-style brush set on the market to date and have studied what works and what does not to create my own extensive and all-encompassing brush sets.

I’m excited to share my Blackletter Dry Brush Procreate brush set with you! These brushes were built in the highest resolution possible from real bristle brushes and paint, so I’m confident you’ll be satisfied with their realistic detail and behavior.

This set includes a total of 20 Procreate brushes, including:

- 16 uniquely textured dry brushes ranging from heavy saturation to light saturation on a variety of different surfaces. These brushes are also highly customizable.

• Upon purchasing, Etsy will email you links to download (Guests can only download this way), or on Etsy head up to You &gt; Purchases and reviews &gt; Download Files

• Read the Quick Start Guide, and download a free copy of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC https://get.adobe.com/reader/ to edit these in - 99% of problems I see are when this software isn’t used

• Once edited and saved, you can either print them at home, at work on the sly, at a local print shop or online via wonderful places like Vistaprint.

FREE COURIER SHIPPING 

I ship from Romania, Europe via courier, with tracking number. 
It usually takes: 1-2 business days within Europe (2-5 business days for larger, heavier packages) and 3-5 business days to US (timing is not guaranteed and doesn&#39;t include any possible customs delays).
A valid phone number is required.
(Business days Mon-Fri, not including weekends and legal national holidays)

These turkey feathers are stitched along on a trim and are approximately 4-8&quot; in height. These turkey trims offer more fullness then ostrich feather trims so they are perfect where one application or layer is desired. However, for an even fuller look two layers or may may be required. 

Each trim is unique and perfect for your crafting or designer needs. Many designers use these feather trims for celebrity outfits or runway shows. You can also use them for your wedding DIY projects, Native Indian headdress or Ceremonial celebrations, fly tying or baits, costume, carnival headdresses, jewelry, feather frames, quill pen, and special performances. Perfect for smudge fans, witch or spiritual creations, and these would add a stunning touch to a dream catcher.

Not all feathers are perfect since they get used by the bird first. However, rest assured that the feathers you receive will be in usable condition. Feathers are sanitized, clean and ready to be used. Wholesale and quantity discount is available on these turkey trim feathers. Feathers are in stock and ready for immediate shipment.

* These transfers will not print white ink. If there is white in the design it will become the color of the fabric your apply it to.
* Each transfer has a ONE time use.
* Image color may very slightly due to screen solution
* Transfer must be used on a substrate coated for sublimation (mugs, tumblers, glass etc.)
* Sublimation prints should be used on at least a 50% polyester count garment that is white or light colored. The closer to 100% polyester you get, the brighter the image. The closer to 50% polyester you get, the more vintage the image.
* Sublimation will NOT work on cotton or dark colored shirts
* You MUST apply sublimation transfer with a heat press.

For use with shirts at least 50% polyester blend, the higher  polyester count makes the design brighter.  These will not work on dark colors unless the shirt is bleached.

Instructions for pressing:
Using heat press tape, tape image to shirt to prevent moving during pressing and causing a double image. Place paper between layers of shirt to prevent bleed through. Press at 385 degrees for 60 seconds on high pressure. Remove immediately after pressing.

These transfers come ready to press with no water markings, printed on quality sublimation paper. I have tested them on my own shirts and they have proven to provide quality prints when applied correctly.

Measurements are given in width and are an estimate. Sized may vary slightly to give the best look for printing.

Due to the nature of the product, we do not allow returns or exchanges. If there is an issue with your order, please contact us within 5 days of receiving your order! It is your responsibility to look over prints before pressing.

📌Most transfers ship SAME or NEXT day! We are not responsible for shipping delays.

Have question? Message us! We are happy to help.The initial print coming out of the printer and to you may be dull and looks faded.

It is important to note that this is perfectly fine and in fact shows us that we are on the right track. 

The reason for this dull or faded looking print coming out of your printer is that sublimation ink is only activated at 392 degrees Farenhieht , and when placed under sufficient pressure. In other words, the correct colour will only appear on the final sublimated product – after you have completed the sublimation process carefully.

356,740862762,81578720,12479281,Probably Drunk **SUBLIMATION TRANSFER**,"**PLEASE READ ENTIRE DESCRIPTION BEFORE ORDERING**

You must use a professional heat press to apply this transfer to your shirt. I personally use between 380° - 400° with light to medium pressure for 85-100 seconds. KEEP IN MIND ALL PRESSES ARE DIFFERENT TIMES AND TEMPS MAY VARY It is its reccomend to have a sheet of paper inside the shirt when pressing and you MUST use a cover sheet (butcher paper or packing paper) over top of the design and entire shirt. You CANNOT use a teflon sheet. You need to prepress the garment for about 10 seconds to get any moisture out before pressing the design. Each transfer is only good for one press, even though there will be ink left on the paper after pressing. A high polyester percentage (over 50%) is required. 100% polyester is recommended for most vivid outcome. Sublimation transfers are for use on light colored materials only, white and light gray work the best. There is no white sublimation ink, therefore white doesn&#39;t print. All white in the design will be transparent letting that space take on the color of the garment. Transfers will NOT have a watermark. Transfers are printed on 8.5x11 paper and design is sized to fit the paper. If you would like a smaller custom size please let me know when checking out. This listing is for a READY TO PRESS SUBLIMATION TRANSFER ONLY. THIS IS NOT A DIGITAL DOWNLOAD.

                                        &quot;Surah An - Nas&quot;

قُلْ اَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِۙ ﴿١﴾ مَلِكِ النَّاسِۙ ﴿٢﴾ اِلٰهِ النَّاسِۙ ﴿٣﴾ مِنْ شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِۙ ﴿٤﴾ اَلَّذ۪ي يُوَسْوِسُ ف۪ي صُدُورِ النَّاسِۙ ﴿٥﴾ مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ ﴿٦



Say, &quot;I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind,

The Sovereign of mankind.

The God of mankind,

From the evil of the retreating whisperer -

Who whispers [evil] into the breasts of mankind -

From among the jinn and mankind.&quot;




The Prophet (ﷺ) revealed in one Sahih (Authentic) hadith that “Allah has revealed to me Ayat the likes of which have not been seen” the ayats he’s referring to are that of Surah Falaq and Surah Naas.

The hadith continues on to mention that the Prophet advised “Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind…” (Surah An-Naas) until the end. “Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of Al-Falaq…” until the end of the Surat.

Together these two surahs are very powerful that it’s been given a special name called 

“Al mu’awwidhatayn” (Arabic: المعوذتان) 

       meaning “the verses of refuge”.


Surah Falaq, begins by saying “I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn”. Here’s the definition of dawn, “the first appearance of light in the sky before sunrise.” This is symbolic for taking refuge in Allah from the darkness or the unknown which is often scary. So whenever you have fears recite Surah Falaq, Allah will bring the light into any darkness. He will show you the way and guide you. His light will break through any darkness or unknown.


Surah An-Naas is read for seeking refuge from evil, this could evil from one’s own heart or could be referring to Jinn’s, shaitan, or evil spirited people. The surah begins with asking to seek refuge in the “lord of mankind” and the last ayat it says “from among the jinn and mindkind”. This is asking us to protect us from those people who may be a bad influence, toxic people and relationships. We all know of the saying, “you are the sum total of the five people you associate the most with”. Reading Surah Nas should be read so we surround ourselves with like minded and kind people.

This boa looks great around the shoulder or used as a trimming for evening wear, prom dresses, costumes, hat pieces and theatrical events. We only use the best quality feathers, hand sewn and perfectly dyed to vibrant colors.


After you receive the boas, please pull them out of the PVC bag(s), preferably outdoors, in order to get rid of debris formed during processing and shipping. The boas should be hung for 48 to 72 hours before use. The longer you hang them up, the better they will look. Chandelle feathers do shed! They will initially shed a lot when you first take them out. ALL chandelle feather boas shed. You can minimize little fly-a-ways by using a light weight aerosol hairspray. Nothing heavy or sticky. All dark feather boa colors are NOT colorfast. Keep away from lighter colors

Feather boas are also washable. Clean the boas by hand washing in warm water and soap. Rinse off the soap with cold water. Then, wipe off the boas with a towel or paper towels. After removing most of the excess water, use a blow dryer to finish drying the boas and maintain their fluffiness. All of our feather products have been professionally cleaned, steamed, and sanitized. 

Weight: 100 grams 
Dimensions: 72 inches Long x 8-9 inches Wide

Need a Sign to make that muddy room a little less unappealing?  This Mudroom sign is just the thing.  It lets people know why it is what it is and adds a little bit of style (at least as you can) :-)  You can also put this sign outside your mudroom to direct them where they need to go, which is hopefully not in your living room.  

Each one of your signs are made to order in our family shop in Madison Indiana. After you order we will take your personal order and cut it out of a sheet of metal and then grind and prepare it for painting. We then put a super tough powdercoat paint on it and bake it in our oven So that you have the most durable and outdoor duty sign available. We are a veteran owned and operated family business so we care about you and your order and want you to love it! We love what we do, our product and our customers. 

There are a different options for hanging your sign: 
1. use hanging putty tack strips (we use the 3M brand) they are inexpensive and it does not leave any frontward marks on your sign.
2. Use double sided tape.  Just like the hanging putty it is great because it doesn&#39;t leave any marks on the front of the sign and gives it a little depth
3. Request to have holes put in your sign and we will drill 1/8&quot; holes in your sign and provide you with 2 nails for your wall at no charge! :-)
You can also read about our hanging instruction in our FAQ and we send hanging instruction with each sign.


All signs are finished in a super tough outdoor duty powdercoat paint in a variety of colors (unless requested bare metal). - For more about this see our FAQ about paint. 

All Signs are made to order, but it should not take more than 1-2weeks.
Please contact me if you have questions – We are happy to help you
Great gift for any loved one or for yourself,

Clear waterslide decals are meant to be used on light color substrates while white waterslide decals may be a bit more visible depending on the image.

1. Make sure the application surface is clean and free of oil or lint.
2. Cut out the decal but leave around 1/4&quot; around edge,
3. Wet the decal in a small bowl of water for about 15-20 seconds. Remove from water when the decal begins to slide off the backing.
4. Wet the substrate and place the decal (with white backing) on the item. Gently slide the backing from the decal.
5. Gently move the decal as you need to ensure it is in the proper location.
6. Gently squeegee the decal from inside to out, using a silicone makeup brush for best results.

8. Seal with epoxy or clear coat of your choice.

SHIPPING:
We try our best to get all decals out within 24 hours after payment is received but we just ask for an allowance of 48 hours to ensure that the sealant is cured for best results.

BR. ROY PARKER&#39;S CRAFT

Calligraphy is a hobby and vocation for Br. Roy Parker, OHC.

Br. Roy’s entire print repertoire is available from The Monk’s Cell Gift and Book Shop.  These are art quality giclee prints.  You can see some of them in our little “art gallery” in the hallway leading from the Pilgrim Hall to The Monk’s Cell. Br. Roy also creates original calligraphy under commission.  Contact him to explore possibilities. These online pictures of the prints are offered to suggest Roy’s craft; calligraphy is best appreciated on actual paper and at its intended size.

ROY&#39;S CALLIGRAPHIC JOURNEY

Roy first became interested in calligraphy upon encountering the book “Sweet Roman Hand,” (ed. Wilfrid Blunt, 1952), Shakespeare’s term for Italic handwriting in “Twelfth Night.” He did little with it for several years, but in 1980 had the opportunity to study with Beva Farmer in Monterey, CA and to become, so to speak, part of the lineage of master calligrapher Lloyd Reynolds with whom she had apprenticed. In the ensuing thirty years Roy has been fortunate to study with the likes of Peter Thornton and Thomas Ingmire, among others, and recently completed a study year with master calligrapher Reggie Ezell, a time he considers transformative to his practice.

In those years the joy of sharing his craft has led him to execute an extensive variety of calligraphic pieces in the form of commissions for those attracted to his work. Part of the drive behind this for Roy is the engagement with creative beauty, with the pleasure of creation, the satisfaction of fashioning lovely things and passing them along. Calligraphy has also been a practice of developing patience and self-knowledge. In a similar vein he has enjoyed offering instruction in the Italic letterforms to a number of students, even as recently as this past January in West Park, and looks forward to such workshops in the future.

Upon moving back to West Park Roy was delighted to find a disused room with ample clerestory windows admitting an abundance of the natural light dear to any scribe. Here he installed the necessary equipment along with a night-blooming cereus for good luck. On any given day, he is likely to be found for a substantial amount of time.",active,1655345690,1655345690,1665886490,1489587414,1655345690,1655345690,1649956221,1,21796522,-1,https://www.etsy.com/listing/518552435/serenity-prayer-calligraphy-print-by-br,3,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,physical,"['calligraphy', 'monk', 'monastic', 'benedictine', 'handmade', 'print']",[],39593900854,5,7,collective,2020_2022,FALSE,8,oz,12,9,0.5,in,FALSE,[],,FALSE,TRUE,en-US,"{'amount': 4500, 'divisor': 100, 'currency_code': 'USD'}",121,[],[]

1801&Co. will reproduce color from submitted print-ready files as closely as possible, but cannot exactly match color and density. Because of inherent limitations with the printing process as well as the effect your individual device display settings has on the color seen on your screen, the accuracy of color reproduction is not guaranteed. By placing an order with 1801&Co., you agree to this limitation. We will try our best to match but due to variations in displays, printers and light sources; we accept no responsibility for color variations between submitted files and the final printed piece.

1801&Co. reserves the right to make minor alterations for functional or aesthetic purposes. Minor alterations may include adjusting slightly off center designs or adjusting spacing to accommodate hardware or holders.

Our products are individually made to order, just for you. Because of this each product may vary slightly. Our allowable cut tolerance is 3/16″ inch. Environmental concerns and manufacturer productions cause changes beyond our control which are typical variations in the printing and laser cutting industry.

Acrylic edges are laser cut. Laser markings may be present, this is a normal occurrence in production of acrylics. Any marking from the laser along the edge less than .1” in depth is considered normal and within any reasonable tolerance for variation.

We will not be responsible for minor scratches, scuffs or heat marks on plastics as this is a common occurrence in the production, printing, stacking and shipping of such products. Markings or scratches in the acrylic less than the size of a nickel are not considered a defect. While every attempt is made to prevent these from occurring through our handling, customers must assume this risk on all orders.

Slight bowing in acrylic may occur during transit. This is a normal occurrence with acrylic material as it shifts into different weather environments, much like wood.

Instructions will be included but it will be up to you to know your press and the process to get the desired results.

SUBLIMATION TRANSFER FACTS TO KNOW
 
*These transfers will not print white ink. If there is white in the design it will become the color of the fabric you apply it to.
* Each transfer has a ONE time use.
* Image color may vary slightly due to screen solution.
* Sublimation prints should be used on at least a 65% polyester count garment that is white or light colored. 
* The closer to 100% polyester you get, the brighter the image. The closer to 65% polyester the more vintage the image.
* Sublimation will NOT work on cotton or dark colored shirts
* You must apply sublimation transfer with a heat press. They cannot be applied with an iron or a Cricut Easy Press.

Shipping to Canada is $29.99. Shipping takes approximately 5-7 days. All other international shipping is $49 and takes approximately 6-10 days.
Save as PDF. PDFs are great for ‘Prints of Love’. Templett PDFs are vector files so the quality is very high and the text will always remain perfectly sharp.

or
• Print at home (with options to print multiple cards per US Letter or A4 sheet, or directly onto card stock). When downloading the final PDF at Templett, you can choose “Safe Paper” or “Trim Marks”, perfect for printing at home.
• Send your PDF to a print center like COSTCO, Office Max, Office Depot, Walgreens, Staples, FedEx Office or ETC

This sublimation transfer is meant to go on shirts, pillow cases, bags, blankets, mugs, tumblers, etc. Please make sure the item you are putting it on is meant for sublimation. And make sure you measure your item to make sure you order the right size transfer.

These transfers are ready to press. They must be applied using a heat press to make sure you get good and even pressure. An iron or easy press is not recommended. The heat press needs to be 385-400 degrees and under medium pressure for 60 seconds.

Sublimation dye adheres best to polyester items. If you are using a shirt you want to have at least 50% poly which can give a more faded vintage look. To get more vibrant colors you want to use 100% poly.

You will want to use items that are white or a light color. The image is dyed into the material so if you use a darker color you will not see the image, but you can do a bleached design on a shirt to be able to see the image and using heather colors are best. These transfers do not print white so anywhere on the image that is white will not show up and it will be whatever color the shirt is.

Since the image is dyed into the shirt you cannot feel the image. It is not vinyl so it will never crack or peel off. This will be a permanent design.

The colors may vary on the screen compared to in person. The image might look dull on the transfer but will be vibrant once you use the heat press and put it on the item.

All measurements are an estimate and will be sized accordingly to the image. All transfers will be printed without my watermark design.

I am not responsible For late/Lost/damaged packages. If you would like insurance to cover those items place purchase using Priority mail. once I drop off at post office shipping is out of my hands.

1801&Co. will reproduce color from submitted print-ready files as closely as possible, but cannot exactly match color and density. Because of inherent limitations with the printing process as well as the effect your individual device display settings has on the color seen on your screen, the accuracy of color reproduction is not guaranteed. By placing an order with 1801&Co., you agree to this limitation. We will try our best to match but due to variations in displays, printers and light sources; we accept no responsibility for color variations between submitted files and the final printed piece.

1801&Co. reserves the right to make minor alterations for functional or aesthetic purposes. Minor alterations may include adjusting slightly off center designs or adjusting spacing to accommodate hardware or holders.

Our products are individually made to order, just for you. Because of this each product may vary slightly. Our allowable cut tolerance is 3/16″ inch. Environmental concerns and manufacturer productions cause changes beyond our control which are typical variations in the printing and laser cutting industry.

Acrylic edges are laser cut. Laser markings may be present, this is a normal occurrence in production of acrylics. Any marking from the laser along the edge less than .1” in depth is considered normal and within any reasonable tolerance for variation.

We will not be responsible for minor scratches, scuffs or heat marks on plastics as this is a common occurrence in the production, printing, stacking and shipping of such products. Markings or scratches in the acrylic less than the size of a nickel are not considered a defect. While every attempt is made to prevent these from occurring through our handling, customers must assume this risk on all orders.

Slight bowing in acrylic may occur during transit. This is a normal occurrence with acrylic material as it shifts into different weather environments, much like wood.

+ My lowercase calligraphy laser engraved on acrylic and filled with white acrylic paint
+ Gold plated ring
+ 2 word max - please include the lettering in the personalization box
+ Choose your acrylic color (see last photo)

BEFORE PURCHASING: I have a ‘modern calligraphy’ style of writing (bouncy, fun, not all letters are the same size, flowy, freehand, lots of variation), if this is not the writing style you like - please do not purchase. If you purchase  - you accept that your keychain will be written in this style. These are handmade/handwritten, so no refunds are accepted, and no replacements will be sent.

*Acrylic is a sturdy material. I cannot be held responsible if your key chain has broken due to dropping your keys, snapping by other items in your purse, etc. No refunds/replacements/credits/exchanges will be given for broken key chains.

Since this is a handmade item, variations and textures are normal. This adds character and each piece is unique in itself!

Listing: Continue Tomorrow Needs You Screen Print Transfer

Printed: Plastisol Inks and Heat Transfer Paper

Graphic Design Color(s): Multi-Colored (High Heat Formula)

Design Size: Adult XL - 12&quot;W

(Size is measured by the widest part of the design.  Please note that not all designs are going to be exact squares, some may be taller, some may be shorter.  However, all designs will be sized proportionally.)

This listing is for a PHYSICAL SCREEN PRINT TRANSFER. You WILL NOT receive a digital download. You will receive a ready to press screen print transfer.

What are Screen Print Transfers?

A screen print transfer (also known as a plastisol transfer) is an image which has been screen printed onto release paper. Instead of being directly screen printed onto a shirt or other item, the design is printed onto transfer paper, then applied with a heat press using heavy pressure.

These screen print transfers can be applied to 100% cotton, 100% polyester, and cotton/polyester blends on light and dark colored garments.

Screen print transfers must be applied with a heat press. They CANNOT be applied with an iron or any type of EasyPress because these devices do not allow enough even pressure needed to properly adhere the inks to the garment.

When applying a high heat screen print transfer, set your heat press temperature between 350-375 degrees Fahrenheit, the timer to 7-8 seconds, and the pressure to heavy.  (Please note your heat press should be difficult to open and close, but not impossible to open and close.  Screen print transfers require heavy pressure to allow the inks to properly adhere to the garment.  If enough pressure is not being used when pressing the screen print transfers, it will cause the inks to lift, crack and/or peel from the garment.  The most common mistake made when pressing the screen print transfers is not using enough pressure allowing the inks to properly adhere to the garment.)

Using a fresh adhesive, lint-roll the surface of your garment where you will be applying your design prior to prepressing to remove any lint.

Prepress your garment for 7-8 seconds to remove any wrinkles and moisture.

Place the screen print transfer face down onto the garment.  (The ink on the transfer should be facing down touching the garment, not the upper portion of your heat press platform.)

Press your garment at 350-375 degrees Fahrenheit for 7-8 seconds with HEAVY pressure.

Slowly peel off the transfer paper while the ink is still hot.  (These screen print transfers are designed to be peeled hot, not cold.)

(Optional: After pressing your transfer and slowly peeling off the transfer paper, we encourage you to reposition your garment on the heat press, lay a piece of parchment paper over the design, and pressing your garment again for another 7-8 seconds with heavy pressure.  This will ensure if there are any “cold spots” in your heat press, all areas of the design will get the proper amount of heat exposure and pressure allowing the inks to properly adhere to the garment and will prevent the inks from lifting, cracking and/or peeling.)

We do not recommend using Teflon sheets, butcher paper and/or pillows when initially pressing your transfer, only during the second press.

A bit of a hidden jem among affordable fountain pens. This pen has a broad, medium-size nib. In its performance it is pretty close to Parker Sonnets when it comes to shading, inking or simply writing. Just like on Sonnet, the stiffer nib and almost perfect balance lends itself to fast-hand-writing. A fantastic fountain pen for any professional or an enthusiast.

Unless stated, items are not customizable. Allowable customizations will be shown on the listing. When leaving information for custom items please double check your details before submitting the order. Text will be copied and pasted exactly as it is typed with the exception of spacing, alignment and occasionally capitalization. Your text will be applied to the overall design layout and feel shown. We reserve the right to make small modifications for aesthetic and production reasons. If you would like something customized further than shown in the listing please use the form below to request a quote.

When placing an order for an item that you design, personalizations must be submitted within 5 weeks of ordering. If the artwork is not submitted within 5 weeks we will cancel your order and refund, less a 10% fee to cover the initial costs of processing your order.

1801&Co. will reproduce color from submitted print-ready files as closely as possible, but cannot exactly match color and density. Because of inherent limitations with the printing process as well as the effect your individual device display settings has on the color seen on your screen, the accuracy of color reproduction is not guaranteed. By placing an order with 1801&Co., you agree to this limitation. We will try our best to match but due to variations in displays, printers and light sources; we accept no responsibility for color variations between submitted files and the final printed piece.

Any metallic, glitter, foil or alike elements will be faux. All elements will be printed using inks. We do not use any real metallic, foil or glitter properties in our signs.

𝑨𝒄𝒓𝒚𝒍𝒊𝒄 𝑷𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒕
Acrylic prints will always be single sided and printed second surface (behind the acrylic) with a white ink plate for color support behind the print.

1801&Co. reserves the right to make minor alterations for functional or aesthetic purposes. Minor alterations may include adjusting slightly off center designs or adjusting spacing to accommodate hardware or holders.

Our products are individually made to order, just for you. Because of this each product may vary slightly. Our allowable cut tolerance is 3/16″ inch. Environmental concerns and manufacturer productions cause changes beyond our control which are typical variations in the printing and laser cutting industry.

Acrylic edges are laser cut. Laser markings may be present, this is a normal occurrence in production of acrylics. Any marking from the laser along the edge less than .1” in depth is considered normal and within any reasonable tolerance for variation.

We will not be responsible for minor scratches, scuffs or heat marks on plastics as this is a common occurrence in the production, printing, stacking and shipping of such products. Markings or scratches in the acrylic less than the size of a nickel are not considered a defect. While every attempt is made to prevent these from occurring through our handling, customers must assume this risk on all orders.

Slight bowing in acrylic may occur during transit. This is a normal occurrence with acrylic material as it shifts into different weather environments, much like wood. 

𝑰𝒎𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝑸𝒖𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝑾𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈
When providing an image for print buyer is solely responsible for checking image quality. When printing on clear acrylic ANYWHERE there is a valid pixel a white ink backer will be printed behind it, regardless of how light/transparent/etc. the pixel is. Buyer accepts acknowledgement of this and accepts sole responsibility for the quality of the image they provide. We recommend vector images to ensure the crispest print or a bitmap with a minimum of 300DPI. If your image does not meet these recommended minimums we strongly recommend adding on a white background to avoid the white pixel spray of a poor quality image. We are not responsible for poor, pixelated prints due to the image quality provided to us. Please reach out to us PRIOR to placing your order if you have quality concerns with your image.

How do I use and clean the feather boas? 

After you receive the boas, please pull them out of the PVC bag(s), preferably outdoors, in order to get rid of debris formed during processing and shipping. The boas should be hung for 48 to 72 hours before use. The longer you hang them up, the better they will look. 

Feather boas are also washable. Clean the boas by hand washing in warm water and soap. Rinse off the soap with cold water. Then, wipe off the boas with a towel or paper towels. After removing most of the excess water, use a blow dryer to finish drying the boas and maintain their fluffiness. All of our feather products have been professionally cleaned, steamed, and sanitized. 

If the strings on the ends of the boa are too long, you may retie the string tightly as close as possible to the feathers and cut the rest off. The boa will not fall apart if you do this.

CRICUT AND SILHOUETTE:

Please note. I do not offer support for Cricut, however, I provide you with some instructions bellow that might help you.

HOW TO UPLOAD FONTS TO CRICUT DESIGN SPACE ON PC:

1.
Unzip your font folder.

2.
Locate the font file inside the font folder. Your font file will be either an OpenType Format (OTF) or a TrueType format (TTF). Double-click it!
Once you double-click the font file, an installation window appears. Just click Install.
Congratulations! Your font is now installed.
Now, the trick to using it in Cricut Design Space is to be sure you RELOAD Design Space before you try to find the font. That usually means just clicking the refresh icon in your browser.

Once Cricut Design Space is reloaded, click the Text icon, type some text, click the Fonts menu, make sure the word “All” is highlighted, and type in the first few letters of the new font you uploaded — when your font appears, click it to apply it to your text!

And that’s it!

Download the font to your iPad or iPhone.

iFont should open with the Open Zip Archive screen. You should then be directed back to iFont. On the left, you’ll see an option to Install the Maker Penwriting Regular font. Tap the Install button. You’ll be guided through a series of menus. Tap Allow. Settings should open showing a window to Install Profile. Tap Install. You may be prompted for your device’s passcode. You may have to tap install a couple more times to complete the process. You should see a screen that says Profile Installed. Tap Done. The font is now installed on your device.

Restart the Cricut Design Space app. Click on the text at the bottom. Click on the All tab because of the app defaults to the Cricut tab. Type in the name of the font you just installed. Tap on it. You should now be back at the Canvas screen. Type in text to see what it looks like.

Label is shown on 5x7&quot; envelope.

Labels will be printed with the information exactly as you send it. I will send your a proof that you MUST APPROVE before printing will begin.

Please purchase white labels if you plan to use them on dark envelopes, or ask me about special ordering another color label.


.....Ordering Instructions.....

1. Choose the number and type of labels as well as the font you would like from the drop down menus. The QUANTITY drop down is to choose how many sets of labels you like to purchase (ie. one for invitation and another for thank you notes would be a quantity of 2). Then add this listing to your cart and purchase.

2. In the &#39;Notes&#39; section at checkout include:

A simple and straightforward user guide is available alongside your template.

-----------------------------------------------------------
DOWNLOAD OPTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------
• PDF - use this option to print on your home printer or at a local copy store
• JPEG - use this option for photo centers, some local copy stores, and online printing
• PNG - use this option for social media, email and text

-----------------------------------------------------------
PRINTING OPTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------
There are several options you can consider to print your templates:
• HOME PRINTER (with options to print multiple cards per US Letter or A4 sheet, or directly onto card stock). When downloading the final PDF at Templett, you can choose “Safe Paper” or “Trim Marks”, perfect for printing at home.
• LOCAL PRINT SHOP
Send your PDF or JPG to a print center like COSTCO, Office Max, Office Depot, Walgreens, Staples, FedEx Office, or ETC. Please check with them what format they prefer. They will most likely ask for your files to be saved with the &quot;Show Bleed&quot;-option enabled.
• PRINT ONLINE VENDOR: 
If you’re considering a professional printer, I recommend ‘Prints of Love’. My shop has partnered with them to offer fast, high-quality yet affordable printing. Plus, free 2-3 day U.S. shipping, 2-sided printing, and envelopes are FREE! This print ready design can be quickly uploaded to their site via my unique link: https://printsoflove.com/ref/onmylistpaperie/
Shipping to Canada is $29.99. Shipping takes approximately 5-7 days. All other international shipping is $49 and takes about 6-10 days.
Save as PDF. PDFs are great for ‘Prints of Love’. Templett PDFs are vector files, so the quality is very high, and the text will always remain perfectly sharp.
-----------------------------------------------------------
RETURNS/EXCHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------
As all files are digital, and no physical products are shipped, it is not possible to return or exchange your purchase, and no refunds can be given. Please contact me before purchasing if you have any questions.

I&#39;m obsessed with recycling and that&#39;s where my passion for paper making evolved from! Now the only paper I use is completely waste free! You can have it too! 

This paper is 100% recycled. These 10 packs of paper are made from scrap paper. This set of paper is made with big colourful chunks for funky patterned paper. They come in 10 packs of A4, A5 and A6 sheets.

These sheets are all hand made and therefore one of a kind. No two pieces are the same because of this there may be some marks or imperfections. These marks and imperfections is what makes the paper so beautiful.

These sheets are all hand made and therefore one of a kind. No two pieces are the same because of this there may be some marks, imperfections or small holes. These marks and imperfections is what makes the paper so beautiful.

These pages are great for writing letters, calligraphy, drawing, screen printing and painting. Acrylic painting works great however this is not the best paper for watercolour.I also love to use this paper for book binding and collages! 

Shipping does not include tracking, however La Poste (the French postal service) is fantastic and with over 800 sales, I have never had a parcel go missing! If you would like a tracked package, that&#39;s absolutely no problem! Just send me a message either before or after placing your order and we can organise an additional shipping fee for tracking! 

I take custom orders and offer wholesale pricing. I can make you a special batch of paper in whatever style and colour you like!

If you live around Evian-les-bains, you can also chose to pick up your order rather than process shipping. It is good for the environment and warm for the heart. Just send me a message to let me know before you place your order.

A hand-illustrated, hand-printed magenta (with satin finish) foil design on 190gsm cardstock.

- 297mm x 210mm (or A4 paper size, portrait).
- Magenta (satin finish) foil printed on 190gsm ivory white card.

The illustration itself was originally made by myself, laser printed, and the foil applied by myself also.

This will arrive packaged in a clear cellophane bag for protection, super sturdy 300gsm stiffener and sent in a hard-backed paper envelope.

All of my foil prints are printed by hand, so each individual print appears slightly different piece to piece. Each print is completely unique and one-of-a-kind!

Please note that there is a beautiful shine on the design when light hits the print. This looks lovely in real life however it is a little tricky to capture on camera.

The illustration featured was made by me, Aby Helme.

• WASHABLE & DURABLE. The artwork will last as long as your shoes last, guaranteed. 

• SHOE SIZES: Listed in US Adult Unisex sizes (toddler sizes available as well, just message me). For Converse, any given men&#39;s size is equivalent to another women&#39;s size, two sizes apart. For example, a US Men&#39;s 6 is the same shoe as a US Women&#39;s 8. 

• EXTRA PROTECTION: I use a special mixture of paint that can be heat set, where I carefully spot heat them at 800 degrees Farenheit. This enables them to be hand washed with cold water. 

On top of that, I&#39;ll also coat them with an invisible, protective, water/dirt repellant layer. Only $10, just go to the link below:

---&gt; https://www.etsy.com/listing/235292920/heat-set-custom-hand-painted-shoes?ref=shop_home_active_2 

• HOW IT WORKS: Once an order is placed, I personally commute to a retailer to pick up the shoe size you need, then start painting. Once they are finished, I will ship them with Priority 2-3 day shipping within the US, or with First Class mail for international orders.

This Nursery Name Sign comes in an elegant flowing calligraphy style font, perfect for your new baby. Make a statement with your child&#39;s name above the crib, bed, on the door, or in the bathroom. These signs are so versatile and can be used for baby shower gifts, birthday presents or as backdrop signs for weddings or parties. We make all of our signs from STURDY 1/2&quot; thick Baltic Birch Wood, we NEVER use MDF for your safety AND ours. These signs will come with hook holes on the back for easy hanging if painted.

♥ The connected name of your choice will come painted.
♥ There is a color chart attached in the photo section
♥ Metallic Gold, Silver or Rose Gold are $15 extra on top of the cost of the sign. If you want a metallic color, please message me and I will create you a special listing to pay. 

Sizes in Height of the 1st Capital Letter

10&quot;, 12&quot; 16&quot; TALL 

♥ If you are wanting this sign for a door, I would recommend the 10&quot; size, however if you have a long name, it may still not fit. Please message me if you need exact dimensions to be sure your sign will work for your needs. 

♥ For names going above a crib or bed, we recommend the bigger sizes, however if you have a long name like Elizabeth or Charlotte, I would recommend the smaller sizes. Again, if you need exact dimensions please message me before ordering. 

♥The price will be per name- If you need two names that have 8 letters together you will need to select two quantities of a 4 letter name not just one 8 letter name. Same goes for if out of the two names one is 5 letter and the other is 3 you will need to select the quantity of one 3 letter name and one 5 letter name not just one eight letter name.

⚜️We use high quality permanent outdoor adhesive vinyl and it lasts very well with normal use. If placing on tumblers or dishes, however, hand washing is recommended.

CRICUT AND SILHOUETTE:

Please note. I do not offer support for Cricut, however, I provide you with some instructions bellow that might help you.

HOW TO UPLOAD FONTS TO CRICUT DESIGN SPACE ON PC:

1.
Unzip your font folder.

2.
Locate the font file inside the font folder. Your font file will be either an OpenType Format (OTF) or a TrueType format (TTF). Double-click it!
Once you double-click the font file, an installation window appears. Just click Install.
Congratulations! Your font is now installed.
Now, the trick to using it in Cricut Design Space is to be sure you RELOAD Design Space before you try to find the font. That usually means just clicking the refresh icon in your browser.

Once Cricut Design Space is reloaded, click the Text icon, type some text, click the Fonts menu, make sure the word “All” is highlighted, and type in the first few letters of the new font you uploaded — when your font appears, click it to apply it to your text!

And that’s it!

HOW TO UPLOAD FONTS TO CRICUT DESIGN SPACE IN IOS 11 OR HIGHER ON AN IPAD OR IPHONE:

First, go to the app store and get a free app called iFont. Once you’re in the app store, click on the Search button down at the bottom and type in iFont. Click on the download icon. After the app finishes downloading, click to open iFont.

Download the font to your iPad or iPhone.

iFont should open with the Open Zip Archive screen. You should then be directed back to iFont. On the left, you’ll see an option to Install the Maker Penwriting Regular font. Tap the Install button. You’ll be guided through a series of menus. Tap Allow. Settings should open showing a window to Install Profile. Tap Install. You may be prompted for your device’s passcode. You may have to tap install a couple more times to complete the process. You should see a screen that says Profile Installed. Tap Done. The font is now installed on your device.

Restart the Cricut Design Space app. Click on the text at the bottom. Click on the All tab because of the app defaults to the Cricut tab. Type in the name of the font you just installed. Tap on it. You should now be back at the Canvas screen. Type in text to see what it looks like.

WHY SUPPORT MY BUSINESS?
Every SVG in my shop is hand lettered and hand drawn! I *don’t* use fonts in my designs! That means it’s 100% my own creation and unique design. 

These file sets can be used for a wide variety of items: t-shirt design, coffee mug design, custom tumblers, custom hats, printables, & more!

These handlettered files come in multiple formats: .svg, .dxf, .pdf, .png, and .ai. The design is sold as-is, and is not editable by the customer since it&#39;s a singular piece of artwork -- ie, no fonts are used.

All files will be contained within a .zip download, available once payment is confirmed & no physical item is shipped to you. The design will be rendered in black, and you may change the color at will! Files are prepared on a digital canvas that is between 8-12 inches wide. Vector files may be scaled up or down without the loss of quality. Your purchase does NOT include the listing images or product photography.

Software to use these files for their intended purpose includes, but is not limited to: Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Design Space (Cricut), Silhouette Studio (Cameo), and Inkscape.

LICENSING
All SVG file sets sold in my shop include commercial use when the design is applied to a physical item for sale up to 500 items. Please contact me for large scale production licensing. You may not resell the digital files in any way or any other format.

THAT LEGAL STUFF
My hand lettered designs are protected by copyright laws. It is a crime to steal them for your own use or profit. I’ve poured years of my life into my craft, and I will come after you. :)

Under no circumstances should the files you purchase be transferred to another person, regardless of the license type. You may not share, transfer, e-mail, or send the files you purchase to someone else for their use. You may not resell the digital files in any form, or modify the digital files for resale. You may not trace the digital files, modify, and resell as your own.

By Deb Tucker
For Studio 180 Design


Four Patches, basic units that seem so simple to make. Just stitch 4 squares together, either individually or with strip piecing and you’re good to go. But anyone who has attempted these units knows that they are notoriously difficult to make perfectly. Either the unit size isn’t quite right, the edges just don’t quite line up, or they’re just not quite square. Ugh. Even experienced stitchers encounter these problems.

The Four Patch Square Up© Tool is the solution. Like all the Studio 180 Design rulers and processes, this tool and technique will have you build your units slightly oversized and then quickly trim them to perfect shapes. The Four Patch Square Up© Tool is designed to work with units that finish to whole or half inch increments, from ½” finished up to 6” finished unit sizes. The tool’s perfectly engineered lines are designed to quickly locate and align with the unit center and the sewn seams, allowing for easy trimming on all four sides. The accuracy is amazing!

Your units will be the correct size. They will have seams properly positioned. And they will have edges that are straight , even, and square. No more guess work! So jump in and give it a try, you will be absolutely thrilled with the results.

DETAILS

Ruler Size: approx. 7&quot; x 13&quot;
Twelve size options from ½&quot; to 6&quot; finished units in ½&quot; increments
Step by step illustrated instructions
Instructions for left hand cutting and trimming

You will receive 10 pages with this download. Pages 76 - 85 of my 2022 CPT book. 
All pages will be watermarked for proprietary copyrights protection.

I have corrected the numerical sequencing issue within this chapter, added vocabulary terms, ICD10, & Modifier suggestions next to codes. I have added CPC exam clinical examples next to codes. My notes have highlighted the key guidelines so that all the written material is condensed to just what the CPC exam requires. I bundled parent to subcodes and noted differences which is a whole system that many pay a monthly service to find. I have added to any anatomy with function details needed for that section of the exam. I have added AKA terms and noted in laymen’s terms what is going on in many of the codes so you will have a REAL idea of what is going on inside code sets. 

Please do NOT share or RESALE these. I put a lot of work into them for you so that these pages can help you pass your CPC exam for the Surgery Integumentary section of the exam. I also mentor for FREE, just find me on messenger under Jen Brewer with the same profile pic for help or with my LIVES on TikTok.

I have gathered exam information from my own personal success and others. As a auditor, I never thought to learn medical coding in order to pass the exam, I knew that I needed to learn what the answers to the questions were telling me to pass the exam. In many examples, I never even look at one word of the exam questions. The answers tell me what the answer is. I help you see that in my notes which is made even more clear with my 6 hours of free interactive of free q&a Lives on TikTok each week.  

I currently mentor everyone on Discord app for FREE. This app is available for desktop or phone version. I have created wonderful rooms and a large study group that I volunteer in daily to help. Please find links to all my free advice at medicalcodingbyjen.com  

I use my success and hiccups to make these notes as comprehensive per section as I can.  Many students who have passed their exam recently share updates on the CPC exam in exchange for my help so I can pass these suggestions on to you by helping me make this pdf as complete as possible. 

The correction on the numerical sequencing issue alone will save you many, many tears on test day. This section has an abundance of out of sequence codes. I hope this will help others in their certification career.

All pages will be watermarked for proprietary copyrights protection.

Because I scan the pages in color, the file sizes are large for Etsy.  Please let me know if you have any questions or issues. I am always happy to help.

Please do not copy, resale, or share these files as I put a lot of work into mentoring and providing this resource for those who need visual written out instruction is a lot of work. You do not need them, and I can teach you how to do this on your own also. Come to my LIVES on TikTok. I am happy to help everyone FREE!

Two pen slots in this model; there are other sizes and other styles available with one- to five pen slots and made from other woods (oak, mahogany, birch, maple, black walnut). These pen display trays are not stained or dyed. They are left in their natural color state and finished with a thin coat of hand-rubbed polyurethane.

This particular mahogany 2-pen tray was made to hold a pen-and-pencil set that was custom made for me by a friend as a gift, but it can be used for just about any slender, thin, tapered pens or pencils (either as a matched set or as individual pieces). I can design and fabricate other custom pen display/holders similar in size and nature. Don&#39;t panic about how the &quot;Custom-made&quot; designation might affect the price; it probably won&#39;t. At least not much. And the timeframe shouldn&#39;t be too long either.

5. Gently move the decal as you need to ensure it is in the proper location.

| THE PRODUCT |

Your greeting card and envelope will be packaged in a clear card sleeve to protect the items; and will arrive packaged in a 5x7 envelope with an additional backing board for safety. 

Processing can take 1-3 business days (Monday through Friday) once an order has been placed, so that I can ensure the best possible print and packaging. Please note that printed colors may vary slightly from what is viewed on screen in listing photos.

About the process: All Billie Claire items are hand drawn and hand lettered original designs. They begin in my trusty sketchbook with a mechanical pencil and my favorite eraser. Once I have finally erased and adjusted and tweaked my designs enough, I ink them in with my favorite Micron ink pens. I then use Adobe Illustrator to digitize my black and white design, and then tackle the daunting task of adding color. Once a design is complete, it is off to a high-quality printshop for printing and scoring. Lastly, each greeting card is hand-folded and hand-packaged in my little home studio, usually to the sweet tunes of Billie Holiday, Sam Cooke, and Biggie.

Made to order on large white Flour Sack towel.
===Details===
The Flour Sack Towels
• Beautifully Embroidered
• Made from quality 100% pure ring spun cotton
• Towel measures approximately 28x28 inches
• Hanging loop in top corner
• Colors may vary slightly from photo.


The Design
• Embroidered design measures approximately 4.33w&quot; x 6.85h&quot;
• Thread color will represent design photo, variations are possible

★ Made of 100% cotton that&#39;s woven in the traditional diagonal pattern - This guarantees a strong, durable material that&#39;s built to last and maintain its maximum absorbency. When kept properly, these flour sack towels can last years before needing replacement and can soak up messes as easily as paper towels.
★ Eco-friendly and cost-efficient - Save the Earth, and toss out those store-bought paper towels. The average household uses about 2 rolls of paper towel in a week, which can cost you around $200 dollars a year. You would be saving that extra money and more by eliminating the extra waste produced by throwing the paper towels away. Help stay green by introducing these flour sack towels into your home or business.
★ Machine Washable - After cooking a family meal or dusting the lampshades, your towels are destined to get dirty; it&#39;s their job! But never mind the mess, because you can throw them in the washer with your clothes. The durable fabric and 100% cotton helps to resist shrinking and produces no lint. It&#39;s easy to add these to your normal wash routines whether that&#39;s hand washing, or tumbling in with the rest of your clothes.

✨WHY THESE ARE RIGHT FOR YOU ✨
When I got married, I was frustrated. I flipped through book after book and nothing was quite right. A lot were almost right and all I wanted to do is combine a few designs together to create something perfect. That&#39;s what I strive to do with each and every wedding that I work with. If you want to merge design elements from 2 suites together, great! If you want to add in a colored envelope or a wax seal or a vellum wrap - we can do that! You&#39;re working one on one with a designer that can change those things to make these uniquely you. I don&#39;t have a limit to the number of revisions you get, that&#39;s not how I want to run my business. We&#39;ll make it perfect.

✨EXTRAS THAT ARE ALWAYS INCLUDED ✨
- unlimited rounds of proofs
- paper swatches mailed out to you if you would like to see your options
- complimentary printed proofs (if time allows - they take about 2 weeks)
- your address printed on the RSVP envelope
- your return address printed on the mailing envelope

**printed guest addresses are an additional $0.75
✨WHAT MAKES THESE SPECIAL✨
My favorite part of the classic collection is the paper. I&#39;m a bit of a paper snob and I&#39;ve tried all the papers. I have these printed a crisp, 120# Mohawk Superfine cardstock in either white or ivory, OR you can upgrade the invites to a double thick 240# weight for extra luxurious design.

Double thick cardstock is quite literally - twice the thickness. These invitations are printed on 240 lb cardstock with an eggshell texture. They feel luxurious in your hands and will make such a great impression to your guests. It&#39;s roughly the thickness of a paper coaster. 

You can see all of the designs in the double thick collection here - https://etsy.me/2zuLrjq

✨SAMPLES✨
Samples are always available and typically ship within 2-3 days. If I&#39;m out of stock I&#39;ll contact you with an updated ship date. Samples will include the invite, info card, RSVP, belly band, envelope liner and samples of both single and double thick paper in white and ivory.

The Tombow 811-9561 2H pencils come in three variants:

- PURPLE H (NEW) - the Plum/Purple Tombow 811-9561 H pencil has a gorgeous SILVER ferrule and hard pink eraser, beautifully thick lacquer, has a downward facing dragonfly and JISMark.

- BLUE 2H - the Blue Tombow 811-9561 2H pencil is uncapped, has the same thick lacquer, downward facing dragonfly and JISMark.

Based on the box and artwork, I believe these pencils were from the late 1980s through to the early 1990s.

Calligraphy is a kind of line art and abstract art that humans express emotions. Chinese is the essence of Chinese culture because it is a unique and visual art that covers Chinese language, history, philosophy, calligraphy, and aesthetics. Its performance art is praised as speechless poetry, no dance of the line, the painting without pictures, the silent music.

This comes with a Industrial Strength &quot;Iron-On&quot; adhesive that&#39;s so easy to use. You can also stitch this on with a sewing machine (if you choose). Instructions are included in each order.

It can be added to any item that is safe for ironing! Think: Purses, Towels, Denim Jeans, Backpacks, Aprons, Skirts, Hoodies... Plus more.

This Patch is embroidered to order so it won&#39;t ship immediately. It will ship very quickly and you will get a tracking number when it ships to guarantee delivery (USA only)

A unique ink that looks white in the bottle but when used on dark papers comes out an almost neon blue.

This ink is handmade in our London studio using natural mica powder and natural binders to create a super opaque shimmery ink. Unlike other inks, this ink has been especially designed to keep the shimmer mixed within the ink whilst in use to avoid the need to be shaken every 10 minutes.

This ink has been designed for use with a dip pen. Due to the nature of the natural mica used, the shimmer can settle over time, so before use it will need a shaken or a mixed. Make sure to wipe the jar and lid clean before closing to avoid the lid sticking.

Our inks are water based and if it is too thick for your nib, a drop water can be added to dilute the ink. If the ink is too watery you can leave the ink with the lid off for the ink to evaporate slightly, we advise overnight.

This ink is water based and over time will naturally evaporate, you can add a drop of water to bring it back to the desired consistency. 

I test all inks with a L&#39;ecoliere nib, but most pointed pen nibs will work. Different nibs will create a slightly different look.

Includes Removable Converter--you can use bottled ink with this pen.
Refillable.
Solid Metal Steel Chrome Construction.
Medium Point Nib.
Please contact me if you need ink cartridges.

A bit of a hidden treasure among affordable fountain pens. This pen has a broad, medium-size nib. In its performance it is pretty close to Mont Blanc Meisterstuck 149 when it comes to shading, inking or simply writing. The line variation is slightly less, but hardly $600 worth, if you compare the two. A fantastic fountain pen for any professional or an enthusiast.

CRICUT AND SILHOUETTE:

Please note. I do not offer support for Cricut, however, I provide you with some instructions bellow that might help you.

HOW TO UPLOAD FONTS TO CRICUT DESIGN SPACE ON PC:

1.
Unzip your font folder.

2.
Locate the font file inside the font folder. Your font file will be either an OpenType Format (OTF) or a TrueType format (TTF). Double-click it!
Once you double-click the font file, an installation window appears. Just click Install.
Congratulations! Your font is now installed.
Now, the trick to using it in Cricut Design Space is to be sure you RELOAD Design Space before you try to find the font. That usually means just clicking the refresh icon in your browser.

Once Cricut Design Space is reloaded, click the Text icon, type some text, click the Fonts menu, make sure the word “All” is highlighted, and type in the first few letters of the new font you uploaded — when your font appears, click it to apply it to your text!

And that’s it!

HOW TO UPLOAD FONTS TO CRICUT DESIGN SPACE IN IOS 11 OR HIGHER ON AN IPAD OR IPHONE:

First, go to the app store and get a free app called iFont. Once you’re in the app store, click on the Search button down at the bottom and type in iFont. Click on the download icon. After the app finishes downloading, click to open iFont.

Download the font to your iPad or iPhone.

iFont should open with the Open Zip Archive screen. You should then be directed back to iFont. On the left, you’ll see an option to Install the Maker Penwriting Regular font. Tap the Install button. You’ll be guided through a series of menus. Tap Allow. Settings should open showing a window to Install Profile. Tap Install. You may be prompted for your device’s passcode. You may have to tap install a couple more times to complete the process. You should see a screen that says Profile Installed. Tap Done. The font is now installed on your device.

Restart the Cricut Design Space app. Click on the text at the bottom. Click on the All tab because of the app defaults to the Cricut tab. Type in the name of the font you just installed. Tap on it. You should now be back at the Canvas screen. Type in text to see what it looks like.

Clay cuneiform pendant featuring authentic Sumerian text. This piece was incised by hand by an internationally recognized expert using a best approximation of ancient techniques. It is a miniaturized version of the circular so-called &quot;lenticular tablet&quot; that was used to train ancient scribes  Reading left to right, top to bottom, the cuneiform signs are to be read as “dingir burumesh me&#39;e mutinmen” which translates as &quot;the (other) gods are sparrows, but I am a falcon&quot; This is a repeated boast of Inana, the goddess of war, love, and impetuosity who was personified by the planet Venus. 

This pendant, approximately 1.25 inches in diameter, comes with an 18 inch waxed necklace cord. It is made of kiln-fired clay that is not glazed (glaze interferes with the all-important shape of the cuneiform wedges and was not used in antiquity). Because it is a raw ceramic, the pendant is waterproof but also porous, and will accumulate a patina with extensive wear, which gives it an antiquated appearance. It can be periodically soaked in a solution of bleach and water.
